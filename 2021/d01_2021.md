# Day 1 (2021): Sonar Sweep

'Part One' and 'Part Two' puzzle descriptions and puzzle input from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/1).

See also, my [Observable JavaScript solution](https://observablehq.com/@jwolondon/advent-of-code-2021-day-1).

## Part 1

**How many measurements are larger than the previous measurement?**

We can create an offset version of the input list that has a lag of '1 ahead'. To keep things general we can parameterise this lag. We then just accumulate number of times the value in the lagged list is larger than the same position in the original list.

```elm {l}
numIncs : Int -> List Int -> Int
numIncs lag xs =
    List.map2 (>) (List.drop lag xs) xs
        |> List.filter identity
        |> List.length
```

```elm {l r}
part1 : Int
part1 =
    numIncs 1 puzzleInput
```

## Part 2

Although described as a moving 3-element window in the question, we simply need to know whether the new value added on each iteration is larger than the one we remove as the window progresses. In other words, exactly as part 1 except with a lag of 3 rather than 1.

```elm {l r}
part2 : Int
part2 =
    numIncs 3 puzzleInput
```

## Reflection

An easy warm-up with just a hint of the puzzle question style we will no doubt see in future puzzles. That is, a detailed description of a process (accumulating sum of a moving window) that can be abstracted into a simpler operation (comparison of added and removed values).
