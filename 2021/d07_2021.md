# Day 7 (2021): The Treachery of Whales

'Part One' and 'Part Two' puzzle descriptions and puzzle input from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/7).

## Part 1

Determine the horizontal position that the crabs can align to using the least fuel possible. **How much fuel must they spend to align to that position?**

### Algorithm

Determining the cost at any given position is simply the sum of the differences between each crab's position and the target position.

Because cost is linear with distance, the lowest cost will be the cost of the median value.

```elm {l r}
part1 : Int
part1 =
    let
        cost crabs pos =
            crabs |> List.map ((-) pos >> abs) |> List.sum
    in
    puzzleInput
        |> AOC.median
        |> Maybe.withDefault 0
        |> cost puzzleInput
```

## Part 2

Determine the horizontal position that the crabs can align to using the least fuel possible so they can make you an escape route! **How much fuel must they spend to align to that position?**

The new cost function is the nth triangular number of the number of movement steps. Here the lowest cost will be at or adjacent to the mean of the input values.

```elm {l r}
part2 : Int
part2 =
    let
        triangular n =
            (n * n + n) // 2

        cost crabs pos =
            crabs |> List.map ((-) pos >> abs >> triangular) |> List.sum

        mean =
            AOC.mean puzzleInput
    in
    cost puzzleInput (min (floor mean) (ceiling mean))
```

## Reflection

A nice simple puzzle with plenty of scope for different optimisations, or even a brute force search.

My initial approach was to apply a sorted descent search to both parts, but looking at reddit, a faster is to jump straight to the median crab position for part one and the lowest value adjacent to the mean position for part two.
