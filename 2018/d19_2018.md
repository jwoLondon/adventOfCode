What value is left in register 0 when the background process halts?

{| part1 )}

## Parsing and data structures

Given the similarity with [Chronal Classification](d16_2018.md) we can share much of the infrastructure necessary to store the instruction set (this document inherits the Day 16 document, so we have all that functionality for free).

What differs here is that we are provided with named operators in the input data and we have a special register for storing the pointer to the next instruction to execute. We can represent both, along with the registers and program of operators, as a record:

```elm {l}
type alias Program =
    { pointerReg : Int
    , registers : Registers
    , prog : Dict Int (Registers -> Registers)
    , ip : Int
    }
```

We can parse the input data to create a dictionary of operations referenced by their position in the program:

```elm {l}
parseInstructions : List String -> Dict Int (Registers -> Registers)
parseInstructions =
    let
        toOp instr =
            case instr of
                [ "addr", p1, p2, p3 ] ->
                    addr (AOC.toInt p1) (AOC.toInt p2) (AOC.toInt p3)

                [ "addi", p1, p2, p3 ] ->
                    addi (AOC.toInt p1) (AOC.toInt p2) (AOC.toInt p3)

                [ "mulr", p1, p2, p3 ] ->
                    mulr (AOC.toInt p1) (AOC.toInt p2) (AOC.toInt p3)

                [ "muli", p1, p2, p3 ] ->
                    muli (AOC.toInt p1) (AOC.toInt p2) (AOC.toInt p3)

                [ "banr", p1, p2, p3 ] ->
                    banr (AOC.toInt p1) (AOC.toInt p2) (AOC.toInt p3)

                [ "bani", p1, p2, p3 ] ->
                    bani (AOC.toInt p1) (AOC.toInt p2) (AOC.toInt p3)

                [ "borr", p1, p2, p3 ] ->
                    borr (AOC.toInt p1) (AOC.toInt p2) (AOC.toInt p3)

                [ "bori", p1, p2, p3 ] ->
                    bori (AOC.toInt p1) (AOC.toInt p2) (AOC.toInt p3)

                [ "setr", p1, p2, p3 ] ->
                    setr (AOC.toInt p1) (AOC.toInt p2) (AOC.toInt p3)

                [ "seti", p1, p2, p3 ] ->
                    seti (AOC.toInt p1) (AOC.toInt p2) (AOC.toInt p3)

                [ "gtir", p1, p2, p3 ] ->
                    gtir (AOC.toInt p1) (AOC.toInt p2) (AOC.toInt p3)

                [ "gtri", p1, p2, p3 ] ->
                    gtri (AOC.toInt p1) (AOC.toInt p2) (AOC.toInt p3)

                [ "gtrr", p1, p2, p3 ] ->
                    gtrr (AOC.toInt p1) (AOC.toInt p2) (AOC.toInt p3)

                [ "eqir", p1, p2, p3 ] ->
                    eqir (AOC.toInt p1) (AOC.toInt p2) (AOC.toInt p3)

                [ "eqri", p1, p2, p3 ] ->
                    eqri (AOC.toInt p1) (AOC.toInt p2) (AOC.toInt p3)

                [ "eqrr", p1, p2, p3 ] ->
                    eqrr (AOC.toInt p1) (AOC.toInt p2) (AOC.toInt p3)

                _ ->
                    Debug.todo "unknown instruction"
    in
    List.map (String.split " " >> toOp)
        >> List.indexedMap Tuple.pair
        >> Dict.fromList
```

## Running the Program

Running the program involves iterating over the three-step process

- write instruction pointer (ip) to the special register
- apply operation pointed to by the ip
- update the ip with the possibly new contents of the special register and increment it

Flow continues until the ip points outside the program.

```elm {l}
run : Program -> Program
run prog0 =
    let
        prog1 =
            { prog0 | registers = set prog0.pointerReg prog0.ip prog0.registers }
    in
    case Dict.get prog1.ip prog1.prog of
        Nothing ->
            -- Outside program so halt
            prog1

        Just op ->
            let
                prog2 =
                    { prog1 | registers = op prog1.registers }

                newIP =
                    get prog2.pointerReg prog2.registers
            in
            run
                { prog2
                    | registers = set prog2.pointerReg newIP prog2.registers
                    , ip = newIP + 1
                }
```

```elm {l r}
part1Day19 : Int
part1Day19 =
    let
        program =
            Program 5 (init [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ]) (parseInstructions puzzleInputDay19) 0
    in
    run program
        |> .registers
        |> get 0
```

{( part2 |}

What value is left in register 0 when this new background process halts?

{| part2 )}

Running the program with register 0 set to 1 reveals the program would take too long to compute directly, so the task becomes one of building a higher-level and optimised program from the instruction set. Doing so requires inspection of the program to identify its structure.

## Stage One: Renaming Registers and instructions

To make interpreting the program easier, we can name registers 0-6 as letters, so as not to confuse registers from their values or addresses.

- Registers: 0 to 4 labelled a-e; register 5 labelled 'pointer'.
- `seti`/`setr` ignore parameter B so this parameter is not displayed.
- operations that affect register 5 are jumps of some kind, relative indicated by `jmp`, absolute by `JMP`.
- `gt..` and `eq..` operations can be summarised as by a ternary operator.
- Instruction at address 16 will jump to address 256, so halting the program.

| Address | Instruction | Param A | Param B | Param C | action             |
| ------: | ----------- | ------: | ------: | ------: | ------------------ |
|       0 | `addi`      |       5 |      16 |       5 | jmp +16            |
|       1 | `seti`      |       1 |         |       3 | d = 1              |
|       2 | `seti`      |       1 |         |       2 | c = 1              |
|       3 | `mulr`      |       3 |       2 |       4 | e = c \* d         |
|       4 | `eqrr`      |       4 |       1 |       4 | e = (b==e)? 1 : 0  |
|       5 | `addr`      |       4 |       5 |       5 | jmp +e             |
|       6 | `addi`      |       5 |       1 |       5 | jmp +1             |
|       7 | `addr`      |       3 |       0 |       0 | a = a + d          |
|       8 | `addi`      |       2 |       1 |       2 | c = c + 1          |
|       9 | `gtrr`      |       2 |       1 |       4 | e = (c > b)? 1 : 0 |
|      10 | `addr`      |       5 |       4 |       5 | jmp +e             |
|      11 | `seti`      |       2 |         |       5 | JMP 2              |
|      12 | `addi`      |       3 |       1 |       3 | d = d + 1          |

|      16 | `mulr`      |       5 |       5 |       5 | HALT               |
|      17 | `addi`      |       1 |       2 |       1 | b = b + 2          |
|      18 | `mulr`      |       1 |       1 |       1 | b = b \* b         |
|      19 | `mulr`      |       5 |       1 |       1 | b = b \* pointer   |
|      20 | `muli`      |       1 |      11 |       1 | b = b \* 11        |
|      21 | `addi`      |       4 |       1 |       4 | e = e + 1          |
|      22 | `mulr`      |       4 |       5 |       4 | e = e \* pointer   |
|      23 | `addi`      |       4 |       9 |       4 | e = e + 9          |
|      24 | `addr`      |       1 |       4 |       1 | b = b + e          |
|      25 | `addr`      |       5 |       0 |       5 | jmp +a             |
|      26 | `seti`      |       0 |         |       5 | JMP 0              |
|      27 | `setr`      |       5 |         |       4 | e = pointer        |
|      28 | `mulr`      |       4 |       5 |       4 | e = e \* pointer   |
|      29 | `addr`      |       5 |       4 |       4 | e = e + pointer    |
|      30 | `mulr`      |       5 |       4 |       4 | e = e \* pointer   |
|      31 | `muli`      |       4 |      14 |       4 | e = e \* 14        |
|      32 | `mulr`      |       4 |       5 |       4 | e = e \* pointer   |
|      33 | `addr`      |       1 |       4 |       1 | b = b + e          |

|      35 | `seti`      |       0 |         |       5 | JMP 0              |

## State Two: Identifying code blocks

We can separate the program flow instructions from the others, revealing blocks of code that perform specific actions (displayed below in order they are first encountered):

| Block | Addresses | Action                            |
| ----- | --------- | --------------------------------- |
| 1     | 17 - 24   | set b to 4\*19\*11 + 31           |
| 2     | 27 - 34   | inc b by (27\*28 +29)\*30\*14\*32 |
| 3     | 1 - 4     | set e to c\*d                     |
| 4     | 7 - 9     | inc c by 1; inc a by d            |
| 5     | 12 - 13   | inc d                             |

## Stage Three: Replace with higher level control flow instructions

The control flow instructions between blocks show a similar pattern - setting register e to the result of comparing two registers and jumping to one of two locations depending on the result. The location jumped to is one of the code blocks above.
This yields a higher level program:

```java
// Blocks 1 and 2:
if (a == 0) {
    b = 867;
}
else {
    b =  10551267;
}
a = 0;

// Blocks 3, 4 and 5
d = 1;
do {
  c = 1;
  do {
    if (b == c*d) {
      a = a + d;
    }
    c = c + 1;
  }
  while (c <= b);

  d = d + 1;
}
while (d <= b);
```

It is now easier to spot that main nested loops are identifying the factors of b by testing all permutations of c\*d, incrementing c in the inner loop and d in the outer loop.

This would be a long process for such a large value of b if we were to use such a brute-force method. Instead, we can calculate the value directly in Elm in about 4 seconds:

```elm {l r}
part2Day19 : Int
part2Day19 =
    AOC.factors 10551267 |> List.sum
```

---

## Reflection

I found part one quite straightforward (albeit taking a while to spot a subtle mistyping in my parsing function that led to `eqri` being interpreted as `eqir`).

Part two I found much harder. I don't work with assembly language regularly (in fact AoC and the [Synacor Challenge](https://challenge.synacor.com) are the only times I have done so in the last 35 years). The process of converting low-level to higher-level instructions described above took me a couple of hours or so. But once in more Java-like language the sum of factors calculation popped out more obviously.

I doubt this process could be automatically replicated as even with the higher-level instructions, this brute-force factors algorithm is too inefficient to operate on such a large value of b. It would be possible to at least extract b from the program automatically and then apply a more sensible factors algorithm, but the main satisfaction to be gained from this puzzle was to identify what the program did rather than to implement it.
