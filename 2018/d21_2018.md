# Day 21 (2018): Chronal Conversion

{( part1|}

You should have been watching where you were going, because as you wander the new North Pole base, you trip and fall into a very deep hole!

Just kidding. You're falling through time again.

If you keep up your current pace, you should have resolved all of the temporal anomalies by the next time the device activates. Since you have very little interest in browsing history in 500-year increments for the rest of your life, you need to find a way to get back to your present time.

After a little research, you discover two important facts about the behavior of the device:

First, you discover that the device is hard-wired to always send you back in time in 500-year increments. Changing this is probably not feasible.

Second, you discover the **activation system** (your puzzle input) for the time travel module. Currently, it appears to **run forever without halting**.

If you can cause the activation system to halt at a specific moment, maybe you can make the device send you so far back in time that you cause an integer underflow **in time itself** and wrap around back to your current time!

The device executes the program as specified in [manual section one](day16_2018.md) and [manual section two](d19_2018.md).

Your goal is to figure out how the program works and cause it to halt. You can only control **register 0**; every other register begins at 0 as usual.

Because time travel is a dangerous activity, the activation system begins with a few instructions which verify that **bitwise AND** (via bani) does a **numeric** operation and **not** an operation as if the inputs were interpreted as strings. If the test fails, it enters an infinite loop re-running the test instead of allowing the program to execute normally. If the test passes, the program continues, and assumes that **all other bitwise operations** (banr, bori, and borr) also interpret their inputs as **numbers**. (Clearly, the Elves who wrote this system were worried that someone might introduce a bug while trying to emulate this system with a scripting language.)

**What is the lowest non-negative integer value for register 0 that causes the program to halt after executing the fewest instructions?** (Executing the same instruction multiple times counts as multiple instructions executed.)

## Examining the Elfcode

The question requires us to examine the set of instructions that make up the program, just as we did for [Go With The Flow, part 2](d19_2018.md). We can take a similar procress of disassembling the instructions to make the structure of the program clearer:

- Registers: 0, 2, 3, 4 and 5 are labelled a-e; register 1 labelled 'pointer'.
- Instruction at address 29 will jump to address 31 if a equals c, so halting the program.

| Address | Instruction |  Param A |  Param B | Param C | action             |
| ------: | ----------- | -------: | -------: | ------: | ------------------ |
|       0 | seti        |      123 |          |       3 | c = 123            |

|      21 | addr        |        4 |        1 |       1 | jmp +d             |

|      24 | addi        |        2 |        1 |       2 | b = b + 1          |
|      25 | seti        |       17 |          |       1 | JMP 17             |
|      26 | setr        |        2 |          |       5 | e = b              |
|      27 | seti        |        7 |          |       1 | JMP 7              |
|      28 | eqrr        |        3 |        0 |       2 | b = (a==c) ? 1 : 0 |
|      29 | addr        |        2 |        1 |       1 | jmp +b             |
|      30 | seti        |        5 |          |       1 | JMP 5              |

Again we can separate the code into blocks between control structures (`jmp` / `JMP`):

| Block | Addresses | Action                                  |
| ----- | --------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 1     | 0 - 2     | Check bitwise &                         |
| 2     | 5 - 13    | Sequential bit operations               |
| 3     | 28 - 29   | if c equals a HALT                      |
| 4     | 17 - 20   | inc d by (b inc) and bitshift left by 8 |
| 5     | 26        | set e with b                            |
| 6     | 24        | inc b                                   |

Block 1 has little direct effect on the the main program. The key section is block 3 which will quit the program when register `c` (3) matches the register a (0). There are no instructions that modify `a`, so that tells us we need to provide an initial value to `a` that corresponds to whatever `c` is calculated to hold.

Blocks 4,5 and 6 find how many multiples of 256 are equal to `e` and sets e to that number. In other words it divides `e` by 265.

## Modifying the program

As currently configured, the program will never halt if we provide a value to `a` that does not match `c`. We can find out what that value is by modifying the instruction at address 28 to always halt (with, for example `seti 9999 0 1` (equivalent to `JMP 9999`)) rather than test for equality with `a`. When the program halts, we can examine register `c` to find the value we need to set to `a`.

```elm {l}
modifiedProgram : Dict Int (Registers -> Registers)
modifiedProgram =
    parseInstructions puzzleInputDay21Modified
```

```elm {l r}
part1Day21 : Int
part1Day21 =
    let
        program =
            Program 1 (init [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ]) modifiedProgram 0
    in
    run program
        |> .registers
        |> Dict.get 3
        |> Maybe.withDefault -1
```

{( part2 |}

In order to determine the timing window for your underflow exploit, you also need an upper bound:

**What is the lowest non-negative integer value for register 0 that causes the program to halt after executing the most instructions?** (The program must actually halt; running forever does not count as halting.)

{| part2 )}

## Modifying the program

Without examining what the code blocks of the program do to register `c`, the part 2 question implies that it will halt after a finite amount of time and therefore that the set of `c` values is finite. It further follows that it must therefore cycle through that finite sequence with some period. Our answer will be the last value of `c` before we cycle for the first time.

To find this value we need to further modify our program so that it permits any initial value of `c` to be provided in order to calculate a new `c` value. As configured in the original program, initialising the `c` register before running the program would not work because the bitwise and check in block 1 resets the `c` to 0.

We therefore modify block 1 so it does not change `c`, for example by jumping immediately to address 6 (`seti 6 0 1`)

We can now run the program, initially with `c = 0`, find out what new value it generates (which will be the same as part 1 answer), and run again, initialising `c` with that value. If we do this repeatedly, eventually we will generate a value of `c` we have seen before. Setting register `a` to the last `c` value _before_ this step will be the longest we can run the original program for.

Adding each new value of `c` to a set of previous values allows us to spot the first repeat.

```elm {l}
runProg : Int -> Int
runProg regC =
    Program 1 (init ([ 0, 0, 0 ] ++ regC :: [ 0, 0 ])) modifiedProgram 0
        |> run
        |> .registers
        |> Dict.get 3
        |> Maybe.withDefault -1


searchRepeat : Int -> Set Int -> Int
searchRepeat regC previous =
    if Set.size previous >= 1 then
        regC

    else
        let
            newRegC =
                runProg regC
        in
        if Set.member newRegC previous then
            regC

        else
            searchRepeat newRegC (Set.insert newRegC previous)
```

This process is very slow (c. 30 minutes) without further modification but it does provide the correct answer:

```elm {l r}
part2Day21 : Int
part2Day21 =
    -- Remove comments to run program (slow: takes c.30 minutes)
    -- searchRepeat 0 Set.empty
    12879142
```

## Reflection

This was a great puzzle, testing not just ability to disassemble Elfcode (which I am rather slow at doing), but to apply some logical deduction to work out how best to modify the code to provide an answer. The 30 minute run time for part 2 is clearly sub-optimal and there is scope to optimise the inner loop as we did for Day 19. I have yet to do this as I am struggling to see what the combined bit operations actually do at a higher level other than blocks 4, 5 and 6 divide e by 256. If there was a bitshift operator, we could remove this inner loop to save some signficant computation. However, I quite like the fact that it is possible to come up with (an albeit slow) answer just by looking at the structure of the Elfcode.

As a side note it was great to be able to use Litvis to reuse the Day 19 code for running Elfcode programs, simply by 'following' `d19_2018.md`. I made some minor modifications to the files to avoid `part1` and `part2` name clashes, but other than that the code was inherited without modification.
