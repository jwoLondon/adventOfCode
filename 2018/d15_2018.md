# Day 15 (2018): Beverage Bandits

'Part One' and 'Part Two' puzzle descriptions and puzzle input from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/15).

{( part1|}

What is the outcome of the combat described in your puzzle input?

{| part1 )}

Solving this puzzle involves three separate tasks. Firstly, to represent the state of the cave system and its Goblins and Elves. Secondly to calculate the shortest distance paths between Elves and Goblins, accounting reading-order ties. And thirdly, to encode and simulate the gaming mechanics.

## Task 1: Parsing and Data Structures

We can represent the caves as a `Grid` where cells are one of a `Wall`, `Empty`, occupied by a `Unit` (`Goblin` or `Elf`). We will also allow cells to contain a distance value for path finding operations.

```elm {l}
type alias Board =
    AOC.Grid MapCell


type alias Location =
    ( Int, Int )


type MapCell
    = Wall
    | Empty
    | Occupied Unit
    | Distance Int
```

A `Unit` will be either an `Elf` or `Goblin` which has a fixed 'attack power' and a number of 'hit points' that diminish over time during combat. To for ease of coding we will also store the location of the unit as part of a unit's state rather than having to rely on the grid to calculate the location.

```elm {l}
type UnitType
    = Elf
    | Goblin


type alias Unit =
    { id : Int
    , unitType : UnitType
    , location : Location
    , hp : Int
    , attack : Int
    }
```

Parsing input can be separated into two stages (which is helpful for debugging). The first reads the input text and creates a grid of characters representing each cavern in the cave grid.

The second stage converts each character into the relevant custom type to create the `Board` on which movement and combat takes place. We will allow the attack power of all Elf units to be set at this board creation stage (uses an attack of 3 for part one, but the ability to change the attack power is useful for part 2).

```elm {l}
parse : List String -> AOC.Grid Char
parse input =
    let
        numRows =
            input |> List.length

        numCols =
            input |> List.head |> Maybe.withDefault "" |> String.length

        caveValues =
            input
                |> List.foldl (\l -> (::) (l |> AOC.match "[#|E|G|.]" |> String.concat |> String.toList)) []
                |> List.reverse
                |> List.indexedMap Tuple.pair
    in
    List.foldl (\( r, row ) -> AOC.gSetRow r row) (AOC.gInit numRows numCols ' ') caveValues


toBoard : Int -> AOC.Grid Char -> Board
toBoard attackPower grid =
    let
        locationID ( row, col ) =
            row * AOC.gColCount grid + col
    in
    AOC.gMapWithLocation
        (\location chr ->
            case chr of
                'E' ->
                    Occupied (Unit (locationID location) Elf location 200 attackPower)

                'G' ->
                    Occupied (Unit (locationID location) Goblin location 200 3)

                '.' ->
                    Empty

                _ ->
                    Wall
        )
        grid
```

## Playing the game

### Moving to the enemy along shortest path

The game mechanics are quite complex, but at the heart is the ability for units to move towards each other along the shortest path. To keep things reasonably efficient, we can allocate a distance from source to target to all empty cells, calculated via a breadth first search.

The queue (`Fifo`) of locations represents cells yet to consider and their distance from the target. It is initialised with `(0, targetRow,targetCol)` and then expands breadth-first to empty neighbours until it reaches the given source location.

```elm {l}
distanceFrom : Fifo ( Int, Int, Int ) -> Location -> Board -> Board
distanceFrom locations srcLocation distanceBoard =
    let
        ( maybeLoc, remaining ) =
            Fifo.remove locations
    in
    case maybeLoc of
        Nothing ->
            distanceBoard

        Just ( d, r, c ) ->
            let
                adj =
                    emptyNeighbours ( r, c ) distanceBoard

                newBoard =
                    List.foldl (\loc b -> AOC.gSet loc (Distance (d + 1)) b) (AOC.gSet ( r, c ) (Distance d) distanceBoard) adj

                newLocations =
                    List.foldl (\( row, col ) locs -> Fifo.insert ( d + 1, row, col ) locs) remaining adj
            in
            if ( r, c ) == srcLocation then
                -- We have reached source, so we're done
                newBoard

            else
                distanceFrom newLocations srcLocation newBoard


emptyNeighbours : Location -> Board -> List Location
emptyNeighbours ( row, col ) board =
    let
        emptyLocation location =
            case AOC.gGet location board of
                Just cell ->
                    if cell == Empty then
                        Just location

                    else
                        Nothing

                Nothing ->
                    Nothing
    in
    [ emptyLocation ( row - 1, col )
    , emptyLocation ( row, col - 1 )
    , emptyLocation ( row, col + 1 )
    , emptyLocation ( row + 1, col )
    ]
        |> List.filterMap identity
```

Once we have the distances of all cells from target to source, we can find the shortest path, resolving tied shortest paths by considering them in row-prime (reading) order in order to find the location of the first step along the path.

```elm {l}
shortestPathStep : Location -> Location -> Board -> Maybe ( Int, Int, Int )
shortestPathStep ( sRow, sCol ) ( tRow, tCol ) board =
    let
        targetDistances =
            distanceFrom (Fifo.empty |> Fifo.insert ( 0, tRow, tCol )) ( sRow, sCol ) board

        tripletAt ( r, c ) =
            case AOC.gGet ( r, c ) targetDistances of
                Just (Distance d) ->
                    Just ( d, r, c )

                _ ->
                    Nothing
    in
    [ tripletAt ( sRow - 1, sCol )
    , tripletAt ( sRow, sCol - 1 )
    , tripletAt ( sRow, sCol + 1 )
    , tripletAt ( sRow + 1, sCol )
    ]
        |> List.filterMap identity
        |> List.sort
        |> List.head


move : Unit -> Board -> ( Unit, Board )
move unit board =
    let
        targetLocations =
            inRange unit board

        -- Find first step of the shortest paths to each target and select the row-prime sorted one.
        nextLocation =
            List.foldl
                (\target sp ->
                    case shortestPathStep unit.location target board of
                        Just ( newSPDist, newSPRow, newSPCol ) ->
                            case sp of
                                Just ( spDist, spRow, spCol ) ->
                                    if newSPDist < spDist then
                                        Just ( newSPDist, newSPRow, newSPCol )

                                    else if newSPDist > spDist then
                                        sp

                                    else
                                    -- Select row-prime step when tied
                                    if
                                        ( spRow, spCol ) < ( newSPRow, newSPCol )
                                    then
                                        sp

                                    else
                                        Just ( newSPDist, newSPRow, newSPCol )

                                Nothing ->
                                    -- First successful shortest path
                                    Just ( newSPDist, newSPRow, newSPCol )

                        Nothing ->
                            -- No path to target so keep existing sp
                            sp
                )
                Nothing
                targetLocations
    in
    case nextLocation of
        Just ( _, newRow, newCol ) ->
            -- Move unit to the start of shortest path (row-prime in the case of ties)
            let
                movedUnit =
                    { unit | location = ( newRow, newCol ) }
            in
            ( movedUnit
            , board
                |> AOC.gSet unit.location Empty
                |> AOC.gSet ( newRow, newCol ) (Occupied movedUnit)
            )

        Nothing ->
            -- No moves
            ( unit, board )


inRange : Unit -> Board -> List Location
inRange unit board =
    let
        enemyLocations =
            AOC.gMap
                (\mapCell ->
                    case mapCell of
                        Occupied u ->
                            if u.unitType /= unit.unitType then
                                Just u.location

                            else
                                Nothing

                        _ ->
                            Nothing
                )
                board
                |> AOC.gToList
                |> List.filterMap identity
    in
    List.foldl (\location -> (++) (emptyNeighbours location board)) [] enemyLocations
        |> List.sort
```

### Playing each game round

In order to 'play' we need to establish how many units we have and consider them in row-prime order:

```elm {l}
getUnits : Board -> List Unit
getUnits board =
    board
        -- Flattening grid is in row-prime (reading) order
        |> AOC.gToList
        |> List.foldl
            (\mapCell units ->
                case mapCell of
                    Occupied unit ->
                        units ++ [ unit ]

                    _ ->
                        units
            )
            []
```

Before we take a turn, we need to check if all of one side has been defeated. If it has, we can calculate the score. If it has not, we take thee turn and check to see if there are still some enemies left to complete the round.

```elm {l}
play : Int -> Board -> Int
play round board =
    let
        units =
            getUnits board

        ( elves, goblins ) =
            List.partition (\unit -> unit.unitType == Elf) units
    in
    if elves == [] || goblins == [] then
        round * ((List.map .hp elves |> List.sum) + (List.map .hp goblins |> List.sum))

    else
        let
            ( completed, newBoard ) =
                takeTurn True (List.map .id units) board
        in
        if completed then
            play (round + 1) newBoard

        else
            -- One side has won, but need play out a final incomplete round to calculate hitpoints
            play round newBoard


playRound : Board -> Board
playRound board =
    let
        ( completed, newBoard ) =
            takeTurn True (List.map .id (getUnits board)) board
    in
    newBoard


takeTurn : Bool -> List Int -> Board -> ( Bool, Board )
takeTurn lastTurnCompleted ids board =
    let
        getUnit id =
            -- TODO: Could we make this a dictionary directly (i.e. not via the board)
            -- and just have the board representing freespace?
            let
                unitLookup =
                    board
                        |> AOC.gToList
                        |> List.foldl
                            (\mapCell units ->
                                case mapCell of
                                    Occupied unit ->
                                        units ++ [ ( unit.id, unit ) ]

                                    _ ->
                                        units
                            )
                            []
                        |> Dict.fromList

                                ( unit2, board2 ) =
                                    move unit board
                            in

                                Just enemy ->
                                    takeTurn thisTurnCompleted tl (attack unit2 enemy board2)

                                -- Have moved but sill noone to fight
                                Nothing ->
                                    takeTurn thisTurnCompleted tl board2

                Nothing ->
                    -- Unit not found, so has been killed
                    takeTurn thisTurnCompleted tl board


attack : Unit -> Unit -> Board -> Board
attack unit enemy board =
    if enemy.hp <= unit.attack then
        -- Killed enemy
        AOC.gSet enemy.location Empty board

    else
        -- Reduced enemy's HP
        AOC.gSet enemy.location (Occupied { enemy | hp = enemy.hp - unit.attack }) board

            case AOC.gGet location board of
                Just (Occupied u) ->
                    if u.unitType /= unit.unitType then
                        Just u

    , enemyAt ( row + 1, col )
    ]

        |> List.sortBy .hp
        |> List.head
```

To start a new game we read in the game board (the network of caverns and Elf/Goblin placements) and start a new round.

```elm {l r}
part1 : Int
part1 =
    -- This takes some time to compute (around 20 seconds), so uncomment to perform calculation.
    --puzzleInput |> parse |> toBoard 3 |> play 0
    188576
```

{( part2 |}

After increasing the Elves' attack power until it is just barely enough for them to win without any Elves dying, **what is the outcome** of the combat described in your puzzle input?

{| part2 )}

## Approach

Thankfully for part 2, the game mechanics are pretty similar. We just need to terminate the game if there are any Elf deaths and try increasing the attack power by one and start again. We continue doing this until we have a game with no Elf deaths.

```elm {l}
play2 : Int -> Int -> Board -> Int
play2 nElves round board =
    let
        units =
            getUnits board

        ( elves, goblins ) =
            List.partition (\unit -> unit.unitType == Elf) units

        numStartingElves =
            if nElves == -1 then
                List.length elves

            else
                nElves
    in
    if List.length elves < numStartingElves then
        -1

    else if elves == [] || goblins == [] then
        round * ((List.map .hp elves |> List.sum) + (List.map .hp goblins |> List.sum))

    else
        let
            ( completed, newBoard ) =
                takeTurn True (List.map .id units) board
        in
        if completed then
            play2 numStartingElves (round + 1) newBoard

        else
            -- One side has won, but need play out a final incomplete round to calculate hitpoints
            play2 numStartingElves round newBoard
```

```elm {l}
tryAttack : Int -> List String -> Int
tryAttack atkPower input =
    let
        score =
            input |> parse |> toBoard atkPower |> play2 -1 0
    in
    if score == -1 then
        tryAttack (atkPower + 1) input

    else
        score
```

```elm {l r}
part2 : Int
part2 =
    -- This takes some time to compute (c. 2 minutes), so uncomment to perform calculation.
    --tryAttack 4 puzzleInput
    57112
```

## Reflection

Because of the intricacies of this puzzle, I did not have time to complete it on the day of release. My initial attempts at shortest path finding were flawed and the depth first approach too slow. One of the difficulties with this kind of problem is that once the data structures and parsing has been defined and an attempt made at coding the game mechanics, it is possible to generate credible but incorrect answers. It therefore required careful test design to ensure the path finding was correct, especially for tied 'reading order' cases. The full suite of tests, including some edge cases, are described in [d15_2018tests.md](d15_2018tests.md).
