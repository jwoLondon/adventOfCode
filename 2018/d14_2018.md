'Part One' and 'Part Two' puzzle descriptions and puzzle input from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/14).

{( part1|}

What are the scores of the ten recipes immediately after the number of recipes in your puzzle input?

{| part1 )}

## Data Structure

We need to be able to store the sequence of recipe scores and query scores from it at arbitrary locations. While the circular nature of the querying might suggest a deque, we have two diverging query points (elf 1 and elf 2), so querying both involves many rotations as the sequence lengthens, so we gain little in efficiency. Instead, an array with fast random access is sufficient. We also need to keep track of the two elf positions with a couple of pointers.

As the sequence lengthens, performing array slicing in order to retreive a block from the end is costly, so we additionally store a fixed length deque that will store the most recent items added to the sequence. We don't need this to be double-ended as we only push to one end of the structure, but Elm does provide a convenient fixed length collection in the form of a [Bounded Deque](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/folkertdev/elm-deque/latest/BoundedDeque).

We can wrap these up in a record and provide a convenience function for initialising it:

```elm {l}
type alias Scoreboard =
    { scores : Array Int
    , recentBlock : BoundedDeque Int
    , p1 : Int
    , p2 : Int
    }


initScoreboard : Int -> Int -> Int -> Scoreboard
initScoreboard blockSize s1 s2 =
    Scoreboard (Array.fromList [ s1, s2 ]) (BoundedDeque.empty blockSize) 0 1
```

## Growing the recipe scores

At the heart of the solution is the encoding of the recipe growing rules. These are straightforward to represent, noting that we may increase the length of the scores by one or two items depending on whether the sum of the two values at the elf pointers are greater than nine.

```elm {l}
nextScoreboard : Scoreboard -> Scoreboard
nextScoreboard sb =
    let
        score p =
            Array.get p sb.scores |> Maybe.withDefault 0

        sum =
            score sb.p1 + score sb.p2

        ( newScores, recentBlock ) =
            if sum > 9 then
                ( sb.scores |> Array.push 1 |> Array.push (modBy 10 sum)
                , sb.recentBlock |> BoundedDeque.pushBack 1 |> BoundedDeque.pushBack (modBy 10 sum)
                )

            else
                ( sb.scores |> Array.push sum
                , sb.recentBlock |> BoundedDeque.pushBack sum
                )

        p1 =
            modBy (Array.length newScores) (sb.p1 + score sb.p1 + 1)

        p2 =
            modBy (Array.length newScores) (sb.p2 + score sb.p2 + 1)
    in
    Scoreboard newScores recentBlock p1 p2
```

We can now iterate over the recipe generation process until we have created enough recipe scores.

```elm {l}
addRecipe : Scoreboard -> Int -> Scoreboard
addRecipe sb n =
    if Array.length sb.scores < (n + 10) then
        addRecipe (nextScoreboard sb) n

    else
        sb
```

```elm {l r}
part1 : String
part1 =
    puzzleInput
        |> AOC.toInt
        |> addRecipe (initScoreboard 10 3 7)
        |> .recentBlock
        |> BoundedDeque.toList
        |> List.map String.fromInt
        |> String.concat
```

{( part2 |}

How many recipes appear on the scoreboard to the left of the score sequence in your puzzle input?

{| part2 )}

For the second part we also need to iteratively generate new scores, this time terminating when the last items added match the puzzle input.

Because we have kept track of the last items to be added after each iteration, we can compare the block with the puzzle to test for a match. The catch is that because we sometimes add two scores in a single iteration we need to compare with both the last 6 and last 7 items (for a 6 digit input sequence).

```elm {l}
tenBefore : List Int -> Scoreboard -> Int
tenBefore pattern scoreboard =
    let
        matchInLast sequence lastBlock =
            (sequence == List.take 6 lastBlock) || (sequence == List.drop 1 lastBlock)

        add sb =
            if matchInLast pattern (BoundedDeque.toList sb.recentBlock) then
                sb

            else
                add (nextScoreboard sb)

        finalScores =
            add scoreboard

        offset =
            if pattern == List.take 6 (BoundedDeque.toList finalScores.recentBlock) then
                0

            else
                1
    in
    Array.length finalScores.scores - BoundedDeque.length finalScores.recentBlock + offset
```

```elm {l r}
part2 : Int
part2 =
    let
        inputList =
            puzzleInput |> String.split "" |> List.map AOC.toInt
    in
    tenBefore inputList (initScoreboard (List.length inputList + 1) 3 7)
```

## Reflection

I found this puzzle quite frustrating in Elm. Conceptually it is not hard to solve, but it does rely on having a data structure that allows efficient query and slicing of very long lists. My initial attempts using an array and array slicing for taking the last 6/7 items for comparison was way too slow in Elm to be practical. This made debugging and spotting 'off-by-one errors' tedious to spot, as generation of a 20 million item array was taking an hour plus to compute. Especially problematic because the examples in the question were contrived not to reveal the 'gotcha' generated by matching against a most recent addition of two recipe scores.

Getting frustrated I coded up the same algorithm in Java, which due to its more efficient array processing, found the answer to part two in less than three seconds. This led me to introduce the bounded deque in my Elm solution so I could avoid slicing the long array. Using this approach in Elm it calculated the part 2 solution, which generates an array of over 20 million items, in around 20 seconds.

Despite a somewhat frustrating experience I was reasonably pleased with the final Elm solution. Not sure if how I might improve the solution reduce computation time further.
