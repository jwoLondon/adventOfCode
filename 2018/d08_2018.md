# Day 8 (2018): Memory Maneuver

'Part One' and 'Part Two' puzzle descriptions and puzzle input from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/8).

{( part1|}

What is the sum of all metadata entries?

{| part1 )}

## Data Structure

Tree structures can be elegantly represented in Elm with a recursive custom type that contains both a node's metadata and a list of any children. Unlike binary trees, there is no need to explicitly account for leaf nodes as here they are simply defined as a `Node` with an empty list of children.

```elm {l}
type Tree
    = Node (List Int) (List Tree)
```

## Approach

Recursively building a tree with a fixed number of child nodes is a simple task, but here nodes can have a variable number of children, so is a little more complicated. Here we create a function to iterate through all the children of each node as we read in the serialized input (`siblings`).

Because a node's serialized metadata are separated from its initial definition, we need to keep track of the remaining serialized input as we recurse through intervening child nodes.

```elm {l}
buildTree : List Int -> ( Tree, List Int )
buildTree input =
    let
        siblings n remainingInput nodes =
            if n == 0 then
                ( nodes, remainingInput )

            else
                let
                    ( node, remaining ) =
                        buildTree remainingInput
                in
                siblings (n - 1) remaining (nodes ++ [ node ])
    in
    case input of
        nChildren :: nMeta :: tl ->
            let
                ( children, remainingInput ) =
                    siblings nChildren tl []

                ( processed, toProcess ) =
                    AOC.splitAt nMeta remainingInput
            in
            ( Node processed children, toProcess )

        _ ->
            ( Node [] [], [] )
```

Once the tree has been built, it is a simple task to traverse it, accumulating the sum of all metadata:

```elm {l}
sumMetadata : Tree -> Int
sumMetadata (Node meta children) =
    List.sum meta + List.foldl (\tree -> (+) (sumMetadata tree)) 0 children
```

```elm {l r}
part1 : Int
part1 =
    puzzleInput
        |> List.map AOC.toInt
        |> buildTree
        |> Tuple.first
        |> sumMetadata
```

{( part2 |}

What is the value of the root node?

{| part2 )}

This is again a simple task once we have built the tree of nodes. We traverse the tree selecting the child nodes corresponding to the indexes in the metadata. Any indices that are out of bounds are removed with a `filterMap`.

```elm {l}
nodeValue : Tree -> Int
nodeValue (Node meta children) =
    if children == [] then
        List.sum meta

    else
        meta
            |> List.filterMap (\n -> children |> List.drop (n - 1) |> List.head)
            |> List.map nodeValue
            |> List.sum
```

```elm {l r}
part2 : Int
part2 =
    puzzleInput
        |> List.map AOC.toInt
        |> buildTree
        |> Tuple.first
        |> nodeValue
```

## Reflection

This is a puzzle which suits Elm (and other functional languages) well as recursive custom types and functions allow easy traversal of trees. Creating the `Tree` type was the obvious approach although it should be possible to process the serialized input accumulating metadata directly. I decided against doing this in anticipation that the second part of the puzzle would require tree traversal.

While the eventual solution was relatively simple, I did spend way too long struggling to find a way of keeping track of the read position of input data when iteratively processing a node's multiple children. After decades of imperative programming, I still struggle with intuitive recursive thinking. I should probably spend more time working with trees and graphs (perhaps the next two weeks of AoC will oblige).
