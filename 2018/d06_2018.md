{( part1|}

What is the size of the largest area that isn't infinite?

{| part1 )}

## Parsing and Data Structures

For convenience and clarity, we can store each point location in its own record.

```elm {l}
type alias Point =
    { x : Int
    , y : Int
    }


parse : List String -> List Point
parse =
    let
        parseLine line =
            case String.split ", " line of
                [ x, y ] ->
                    Just (Point (AOC.toInt x) (AOC.toInt y))

                _ ->
                    Nothing
    in
    List.map parseLine >> List.filterMap identity
```

Because the locations are placed on an integer-rounded grid using Manhatten distances, it makes sense to represent the space as a grid, which we can represent with the grid functions of [aoc.md](aoc.md).

## Approach

The problem requires us to construct a [Voronoi diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram) from the input locations. We will only consider bounded (finite) regions of the diagram. Unlike a Voronoi diagram using Euclidean distances, the bounded regions never extend to the minimum bounding rectangle (MBR) of the input points, illustrated here using the example from the question:

![Manhattan Voronoi](../images/manhattanVoronoi.png)

This MBR gives us the grid dimensions we can use to solve the puzzle. We adjust the input point coordinates to fit in this MBR:

```elm {l}
points : List Point
points =
    let
        minX =
            parse puzzleInput |> List.map .x |> List.minimum |> Maybe.withDefault 0

        minY =
            parse puzzleInput |> List.map .y |> List.minimum |> Maybe.withDefault 0

        moveToOrigin p =
            { p | x = p.x - minX, y = p.y - minY }
    in
    parse puzzleInput |> List.map moveToOrigin


numGridRows : Int
numGridRows =
    List.foldl (\p my -> max my p.y) 0 points |> (+) 1


numGridCols : Int
numGridCols =
    List.foldl (\p mx -> max mx p.x) 0 points |> (+) 1
```

In order to identify whether any given location has more than one nearest neighbour, we will need to be able to encode each location with the point ID of its neighbour. Rather than store this explicitly (a-f in the question example), we can calculate a 'location hash' based on a point's coordinates and the grid width:

```elm {l}
pointID : Point -> Int
pointID p =
    p.y * numGridCols + p.x
```

To build the Voronoi regions, we have to find the location hash of the nearest point to any given grid cell. If there is more than one such point, it is invalidated with a negative hash:

```elm {l}
nearest : List Point -> ( Int, Int ) -> Int
nearest ps ( x, y ) =
    let
        distanceTo p =
            abs (x - p.x) + abs (y - p.y)

        minDist p ( pID, dMin ) =
            if distanceTo p == dMin then
                ( -1, dMin )

            else if distanceTo p < dMin then
                ( pointID p, distanceTo p )

            else
                ( pID, dMin )
    in
    List.foldl minDist ( 0, 99999 ) ps
        |> Tuple.first
```

We can now solve by generating the grid containing positive IDs for non-equidistant cells and invalidating IDs of regions that reach the edge cells. The frequency of the commonest valid ID gives us our answer.

```elm {l r}
part1 : Int
part1 =
    let
        dGrid =
            AOC.gMapWithLocation (\coord _ -> nearest points coord) (AOC.gInit numGridRows numGridCols -1)

        edgeIDs =
            (AOC.gGetRow 0 dGrid |> Maybe.withDefault [])
                ++ (AOC.gGetRow (numGridRows - 1) dGrid |> Maybe.withDefault [])
                ++ (AOC.gGetCol 0 dGrid |> Maybe.withDefault [])
                ++ (AOC.gGetCol (numGridCols - 1) dGrid |> Maybe.withDefault [])
                |> AOC.unique

        interiors =
            dGrid
                |> AOC.gToList
                |> List.filter (\x -> x /= -1 && not (List.member x edgeIDs))
    in
    AOC.modeCount interiors |> Maybe.withDefault -1
```

{( part2 |}

What is the size of the region containing all locations which have a total distance to all given coordinates of less than 10000?

{| part2 )}

The second part is more straightforward in that we do not need to construct a grid explicitly, but instead test the neighbour distance of all locations within the MBR to see if it is within the maximum total distance of 10000:

```elm {l}
withinTotalDistance : List Point -> Int -> ( Int, Int ) -> Bool
withinTotalDistance ps maxDist ( x, y ) =
    let
        dist p =
            abs (x - p.x) + abs (y - p.y)

        minDist p ( nearestP, dMin ) =
            if dist p < dMin then
                ( p, dist p )

            else
                ( nearestP, dMin )
    in
    List.foldl ((+) << dist) 0 ps < maxDist
```

```elm {l r}
part2 : Int
part2 =
    let
        coords =
            List.range 0 (numGridRows - 1)
                |> List.concatMap (\x -> List.map (\y -> ( x, y )) (List.range 0 (numGridCols - 1)))
    in
    List.map (withinTotalDistance points 10000) coords |> List.filter identity |> List.length
```

## Reflection

The problem was immediately recognisable as relating to Voronoi diagrams and I felt "at home" with this one. What wasn't so obvious to me, but pleasing to discover, were the extra properties of a Voronoi diagram using a Manhattan metric. In particular that interior bounded regions are so easily computable (it is much messier with Euclidean distances).

Compared to some of the previous puzzles, I made fewer mistakes so the process of solving it was more satisfying. I managed to get the answers relatively quickly (for me), but did spend a lot of time subsequently cleaning up code, refactoring and moving more common operations to [Aoc.elm](../src/Aoc.elm).
