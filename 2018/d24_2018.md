## Parsing and data structures

The relatively complex set of attributes of the 'unita' that make up a 'groupa' that make up 'armies' can be represented with appropriate records and custom types.

### Units

```elm {l}
type alias Unit =
    { hp : Int
    , imm : List Attack
    , weak : List Attack
    , dam : Int
    , atk : Attack
    , initiative : Int
    }


type Attack
    = Radiation
    | Bludgeon
    | Cold
    | Fire
    | Slash
```

### Groups

```elm {l}
type Side
    = ImmuneSystem
    | Infection


type alias Group =
    { nUnits : Int
    , unit : Unit
    , side : Side
    }
```

### Parsing

The number of input items is relatively small (20) but each is relatively complex (for example, the order of weak and immune defences varies between lines), so for now, rather than creating a regex for parsing, we will define the immune system and infection groups directly.

```elm {l}
parseImmune : List Group
parseImmune =
    [ Group 6638 (Unit 2292 [] [ Radiation ] 3 Cold 18) ImmuneSystem
    , Group 3906 (Unit 12319 [ Bludgeon, Cold, Fire ] [] 24 Cold 14) ImmuneSystem
    , Group 2114 (Unit 7254 [ Fire, Radiation ] [] 25 Radiation 12) ImmuneSystem
    , Group 3157 (Unit 1184 [] [ Bludgeon ] 3 Cold 9) ImmuneSystem
    , Group 502 (Unit 10367 [] [ Bludgeon ] 181 Fire 13) ImmuneSystem
    , Group 1017 (Unit 10287 [] [] 88 Cold 1) ImmuneSystem
    , Group 20 (Unit 1333 [ Radiation, Slash ] [ Bludgeon ] 508 Fire 3) ImmuneSystem
    , Group 6263 (Unit 6146 [] [] 9 Cold 2) ImmuneSystem
    , Group 5294 (Unit 7781 [ Fire ] [ Slash ] 12 Slash 5) ImmuneSystem
    , Group 807 (Unit 4206 [] [ Slash, Bludgeon ] 44 Fire 7) ImmuneSystem
    ]


parseInfection : List Group
parseInfection =
    [ Group 1756 (Unit 36633 [ Bludgeon ] [] 38 Bludgeon 17) Infection
    , Group 1087 (Unit 39027 [] [] 64 Slash 10) Infection
    , Group 2744 (Unit 49920 [] [ Slash ] 30 Fire 4) Infection
    , Group 3849 (Unit 21334 [] [ Bludgeon ] 10 Cold 6) Infection
    , Group 631 (Unit 37995 [] [ Radiation ] 85 Fire 11) Infection
    , Group 770 (Unit 45051 [] [ Radiation, Slash ] 114 Radiation 20) Infection
    , Group 1742 (Unit 41529 [ Cold, Fire ] [] 46 Bludgeon 19) Infection
    , Group 139 (Unit 31968 [] [ Slash ] 458 Cold 16) Infection
    , Group 5191 (Unit 28059 [] [] 8 Radiation 8) Infection
    , Group 5797 (Unit 33966 [] [] 11 Cold 15) Infection
    ]
```

We can create simple methods for extracting the attributes we will need from these records:

```elm {l}
power : Group -> Int
power grp =
    grp.nUnits * grp.unit.dam


powerThenInitiative : Group -> ( Int, Int )
powerThenInitiative grp =
    ( -1 * grp.nUnits * grp.unit.dam, -1 * grp.unit.initiative )


damageThenPowerThenInitiative : Group -> Group -> ( Int, Int, Int )
damageThenPowerThenInitiative aGrp dGrp =
    ( -1 * damage aGrp dGrp
    , -1 * dGrp.nUnits * dGrp.unit.dam
    , -1 * dGrp.unit.initiative
    )


damage : Group -> Group -> Int
damage aGrp dGrp =
    if List.member aGrp.unit.atk dGrp.unit.weak then
        2

    else if List.member aGrp.unit.atk dGrp.unit.imm then
        0

    else
        1
```

## Rules of Combat

Let's separate the two phases of combat.

### Target Selection

Firstly, we have the selection, which is based on ordering attacking and defending groups as specified in the question.

```elm {l}
selection : List Group -> List Group -> List ( Group, Maybe Group )
selection atkGroups defGroups =
    let
        aSorted =
            atkGroups
                |> List.sortBy powerThenInitiative

        dSorted atkGrp =
            List.sortBy (damageThenPowerThenInitiative atkGrp)

        chooseTarget aGrps dGrps combatants =
            case aGrps of
                [] ->
                    combatants

                atkHd :: atkTl ->
                    case dSorted atkHd dGrps of
                        [] ->
                            -- No defenders available for this attacker
                            chooseTarget atkTl dGrps (( atkHd, Nothing ) :: combatants)

                        defHd :: defTl ->
                            -- Most vulnerable defender against this attack is immune, so no comabt for attacker
                            if damage atkHd defHd == 0 then
                                chooseTarget atkTl dGrps (( atkHd, Nothing ) :: combatants)

                            else
                                -- Matched attacker with most vulnerable defender.
                                chooseTarget atkTl defTl (( atkHd, Just defHd ) :: combatants)
    in
    chooseTarget aSorted defGroups []
```

##Â Combat

The trick in defining the combat phase is to recognise that during combat, a group that is yet to attack may have itself been attack and so reducing its power. To manage this dynamic change during battle, we can create a dictionary of group IDs to groups. The battle sequence is defined by a fixed sequence of group ID pairs (attackerID,defenderID) and we can lookup and amend the groups in dictionary as battle proceeds.

We can use a group's `initiative` as its ID as these are unique to each group and unchanging.

```elm {l}
combat : List ( Group, Maybe Group ) -> ( List Group, List Group )
combat combatants =
    let
        groups =
            combatants
                |> List.map (\( aGrp, _ ) -> ( aGrp.unit.initiative, aGrp ))
                |> Dict.fromList

        validCombatant ( aGrp, maybeDGrp ) =
            case maybeDGrp of
                Just dGrp ->
                    Just ( aGrp, dGrp )

                Nothing ->
                    Nothing

        sortedIDs =
            combatants
                |> List.filterMap validCombatant
                |> List.sortBy (\( aGrp, dGrp ) -> aGrp.unit.initiative)
                |> List.reverse
                |> List.map (\( atk, def ) -> ( atk.unit.initiative, def.unit.initiative ))

        fight ( aID, dID ) grps =
            case ( Dict.get aID grps, Dict.get dID grps ) of
                ( Just aGrp, Just dGrp ) ->
                    let
                        dam =
                            power aGrp * damage aGrp dGrp

                        unitsKilled =
                            dam // dGrp.unit.hp
                    in
                    if unitsKilled >= dGrp.nUnits then
                        -- Attacker has killed all defender's units
                        Dict.remove dGrp.unit.initiative grps

                    else
                        Dict.insert dGrp.unit.initiative { dGrp | nUnits = dGrp.nUnits - unitsKilled } grps

                _ ->
                    grps
    in
    List.foldl fight groups sortedIDs
        |> Dict.values
        |> List.partition (\grp -> grp.side == ImmuneSystem)
```

A battle involves repeated selection and combat until the outcome of a combat results in groups from one side only. We need to guard against the possiblity that the damage of the remaining depleted units of both sides is not sufficient to remove any enemy units, so we need to check for a stalemate as well as any one side winning.

```elm {l}
battle : List Group -> List Group -> List Group
battle imGroups inGroups =
    let
        unitsBefore =
            List.map .nUnits (imGroups ++ inGroups) |> List.sum

        unitsAfter =
            List.map .nUnits (im2 ++ in2) |> List.sum

        ( im2, in2 ) =
            combat (selection imGroups inGroups ++ selection inGroups imGroups)
    in
    if unitsBefore == unitsAfter || im2 == [] || in2 == [] then
        im2 ++ in2

    else
        battle im2 in2
```

Finally, we commence battle and count the umber of units.

```elm {l r}
part1 : Int
part1 =
    battle parseInfection parseImmune
        |> List.map .nUnits
        |> List.sum
```

{( part2 |}

How many units does the immune system have left after getting the smallest boost it needs to win?

{| part2 )}

## Boosting the Immune System

Incrementing the attack damage of the immune system's groups is simple:

```elm {l}
incBoost : List Group -> List Group
incBoost grp =
    let
        boostedUnit unit =
            { unit | dam = unit.dam + 1 }
    in
    List.map (\g -> { g | unit = boostedUnit g.unit }) grp
```

Now we just increment the immune system damage until it results in a victorious battle.

```elm {l}
minBoost : List Group -> List Group -> Int
minBoost infGroup immGroup =
    let
        immuneOnly =
            List.map .side >> List.all ((==) ImmuneSystem)

        battleOutcome =
            battle infGroup immGroup
    in
    if immuneOnly battleOutcome then
        battleOutcome |> List.map .nUnits |> List.sum

    else
        minBoost infGroup (incBoost immGroup)
```

```elm {l r}
part2 : Int
part2 =
    minBoost parseInfection parseImmune
```

## Reflection

Another puzzle in the 'code the complex rules carefully' category, but enjoyable nonetheless. This required quite a bit of custom sorting, which thankfully is quite straightforward in Elm using [List.sortBy](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/core/latest/List#sortBy). Placing the comparable sort criteria into a tuple allowed a single call to `sortBy` for a sequence of chained sort operations.

I was troubled with a hard to spot bug (which passed the test, but not real input) where I had mistakenly removed any non-combatants after battle. This erroneously removed healthy units that were simply unable to find an enemy to attack. This passed the test because that only occurs on the first round (where the removal wasn't applied prior to any battle).

For part 2, I thought I was going to need to do some kind of binary search to find the lowest boost value, but thought I'd try an incremental approach first. As this yielded a result in a couple of seconds, I didn't feel the need to make this more efficient.

## Testing

```elm {l}
testImmune : List Group
testImmune =
    [ Group 17 (Unit 5390 [] [ Radiation, Bludgeon ] 4507 Fire 2) ImmuneSystem
    , Group 989 (Unit 1274 [ Fire ] [ Bludgeon, Slash ] 25 Slash 3) ImmuneSystem
    ]


testInfection : List Group
testInfection =
    [ Group 801 (Unit 4706 [] [ Radiation ] 116 Bludgeon 1) Infection
    , Group 4485 (Unit 2961 [ Radiation ] [ Fire, Cold ] 12 Slash 4) Infection
    ]


groupText : Group -> String
groupText grp =
    sideText grp.side ++ " id: " ++ String.fromInt grp.unit.initiative ++ ", " ++ String.fromInt grp.nUnits ++ " units. Pow:" ++ String.fromInt (power grp)


groupTextShort : Group -> String
groupTextShort grp =
    sideText grp.side ++ " " ++ String.fromInt grp.unit.initiative


sideText : Side -> String
sideText side =
    case side of
        Infection ->
            "Infection"

        ImmuneSystem ->
            "Immune System"


combatText : ( Group, Maybe Group ) -> String
combatText ( grp, maybeDef ) =
    case maybeDef of
        Just dGrp ->
            groupTextShort grp ++ " would deal defending " ++ groupTextShort dGrp ++ " " ++ String.fromInt (power grp * damage grp dGrp) ++ " damage"

        Nothing ->
            groupTextShort grp ++ " has noone to fight"
```
