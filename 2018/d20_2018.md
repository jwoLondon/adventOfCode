# Day 20 (2018): A Regular Map

'Part One' and 'Part Two' puzzle descriptions and puzzle input from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/20).

{( part1|}

**What is the largest number of doors you would be required to pass through to reach a room?** That is, find the room for which the shortest path from your starting location to that room would require passing through the most doors; what is the fewest doors you can pass through to reach it?

{| part1 )}

## Data Structure

While the question describes rooms, doors and walls, all we really need to store in order to navigate the facility is the connections between rooms. A room itself can be represented by a 2d location on an unbounded plane associated with 0 to 4 neighbouring rooms. This graph structure is conveniently represented as a dictionary:

```elm {l}
type alias Location =
    ( Int, Int )


type alias Rooms =
    Dict Location (Set Location)
```

We can add a connection between two adjacent rooms (implying a door between them) by updating the dictionary representing the tree of connected rooms:

```elm {l}
connect : Location -> Location -> Rooms -> Rooms
connect room1 room2 =
    let
        addConnect r1 r2 rs =
            case Dict.get r1 rs of
                Just connected ->
                    Dict.insert r1 (Set.insert r2 connected) rs

                Nothing ->
                    Dict.insert r1 (Set.singleton r2) rs
    in
    addConnect room1 room2 >> addConnect room2 room1
```

## Parsing

The main effort involves parsing the string of instructions to generate the appropriate tree of rooms. As we do this, the parser needs to keep track of the rooms it has added, the input instructions yet to process, the current room. As we parse the input sequentially, we also need to keep track of the location at the start ('anchor') of a group (`(`), so that when we identify alternatives (`|`), we can 'backtrack' to the anchor before processing each set of alternative instructions.

We can represent all of these in a record:

```elm {l}
type alias Parser =
    { location : Location
    , anchor : Location
    , todo : List Char
    , rooms : Rooms
    }
```

Parsing needs to account for movement instructions (`N`, `S`, `E` and `W`) where we simply add a new room for each instruction; the start of a group, where we need to log a new 'anchor'; the end of a group; and an alternative (`|`), which can be regarded as an additional group sharing the same anchor as its alternatives:

```elm {l}
parse : Parser -> Parser
parse parser =
    case parser.todo of
        [] ->
            parser

        hd :: tl ->
            if hd == 'N' || hd == 'E' || hd == 'S' || hd == 'W' then
                parse (addRoom parser)

            else if hd == '(' then
                let
                    subSequence =
                        parse { parser | todo = tl, anchor = parser.location }
                in
                parse { parser | todo = subSequence.todo, rooms = subSequence.rooms }

            else if hd == ')' then
                { parser | todo = tl, location = parser.anchor }

            else if hd == '|' then
                -- We've ended a subsequence and about to start another
                parse { parser | todo = tl, location = parser.anchor }

            else
                parse { parser | todo = tl }
```

```elm {l}
addRoom : Parser -> Parser
addRoom parser =
    let
        adjRoom dir ( row, col ) =
            case dir of
                'N' ->
                    ( row - 1, col )

                'E' ->
                    ( row, col + 1 )

                'S' ->
                    ( row + 1, col )

                'W' ->
                    ( row, col - 1 )

                _ ->
                    Debug.todo "Unknown character in input"
    in
    case parser.todo of
        [] ->
            parser

        hd :: tl ->
            { parser
                | location = adjRoom hd parser.location
                , rooms = connect parser.location (adjRoom hd parser.location) parser.rooms
                , todo = tl
            }
```

## Finding Distances from the start

Once we have a maze we can use a now standard breadth-first search to find the distance (number of doors to open) from the start to any other room.

```elm {l}
buildDist : Rooms -> Dict Location Int
buildDist rooms =
    let
        build todo distances =
            case Fifo.remove todo of
                ( Nothing, _ ) ->
                    distances

                ( Just location, remaining ) ->
                    let
                        distToLoc =
                            Dict.get location distances |> Maybe.withDefault 0

                        unvisited =
                            Dict.get location rooms
                                |> Maybe.withDefault Set.empty
                                |> Set.filter (\loc -> not (Dict.member loc distances))
                    in
                    build
                        (Set.foldl Fifo.insert remaining unvisited)
                        (Set.foldl
                            (\neighbour ds ->
                                if not (Dict.member neighbour ds) then
                                    Dict.insert neighbour (distToLoc + 1) ds

                                else
                                    ds
                            )
                            distances
                            unvisited
                        )
    in
    build (Fifo.empty |> Fifo.insert ( 0, 0 )) (Dict.singleton ( 0, 0 ) 0)
```

To find distance of the furthest room, we simply find the largest value in the dictionary of distances:

```elm {l r}
part1 : Int
part1 =
    parse (Parser ( 0, 0 ) ( 0, 0 ) (String.toList puzzleInput) Dict.empty)
        |> .rooms
        |> buildDist
        |> Dict.values
        |> List.maximum
        |> Maybe.withDefault -1
```

{( part2 |}

How many rooms have a shortest path from your current location that pass through at least 1000 doors?

{| part2 )}

This is a nice easy extension to the problem in that we just need to count the number of room distances of at least 1000:

```elm {l r}
part2 : Int
part2 =
    parse (Parser ( 0, 0 ) ( 0, 0 ) (String.toList puzzleInput) Dict.empty)
        |> .rooms
        |> buildDist
        |> Dict.values
        |> List.filter (\n -> n >= 1000)
        |> List.length
```

## Reflection

For practical reasons I wasn't able to work on this problem on the day it was released so revisited it a few days later. I loved this one, perhaps in part because the time pressure was off and I was able to spend time writing tests for maze generation and distance calculation (see the `testRoom` below). There is something satisfying about turning the instruction sequences into a maze.

There was nothing too complicated here. The only part that required a bit more thought was ensuring the location at the start of a group was stored so the parser could backtrack to this anchor when processing alternatives in a group. I had started by storing all the relevant data needed by the parser in a tuple, but switching to a record simplified and clarified the coding.

Part two was a trivial extension (as a slow programmer, it only took me 30 seconds to provide the extra code) so I was quite surprised to see this taking up to 7 minutes extra on the top 100 leaderboard. I guess they must have not built a distance graph to answer part 1.

## Tests

```elm {l m}
testRoom : List String
testRoom =
    let
        rooms =
            parse (Parser ( 0, 0 ) ( 0, 0 ) (String.toList test2) Dict.empty)
                |> .rooms

        distances =
            buildDist rooms
    in
    gridDisplay distances rooms
        |> AOC.gToLists
        |> List.map (\r -> "\n    " ++ String.concat r)
```

```elm {l}
test1 : String
test1 =
    "^WNE$"


test2 : String
test2 =
    "^ENWWW(NEEE|SSE(EE|N))$"


test3 : String
test3 =
    "^ENNWSWW(NEWS|)SSSEEN(WNSE|)EE(SWEN|)NNN$"


test4 : String
test4 =
    "^ESSWWN(E|NNENN(EESS(WNSE|)SSS|WWWSSSSE(SW|NNNE)))$"


test5 : String
test5 =
    "^WSSEESWWWNW(S|NENNEEEENN(ESSSSW(NWSW|SSEN)|WSWWN(E|WWS(E|SS))))$"
```

```elm {l=hidden}
gridDisplay : Dict Location Int -> Rooms -> AOC.Grid String
gridDisplay distances rooms =
    let
        ( top, left ) =
            List.foldl
                (\( row, col ) ( rowMin, colMin ) -> ( min row rowMin, min col colMin ))
                ( 9999, 9999 )
                (Dict.keys rooms)

        ( bottom, right ) =
            List.foldl
                (\( row, col ) ( rowMax, colMax ) -> ( max row rowMax, max col colMax ))
                ( -9999, -9999 )
                (Dict.keys rooms)

        grid =
            AOC.gInit ((bottom - top + 1) * 2 + 1) ((right - left + 1) * 2 + 1) "# "

        roomPos ( row, col ) =
            ( (row - top) * 2 + 1, (col - left) * 2 + 1 )

        doorPos ( row1, col1 ) ( row2, col2 ) =
            ( (row1 + row2 - 2 * top) + 1, (col1 + col2 - 2 * left) + 1 )
    in
    Dict.foldl
        (\loc connected grd ->
            Set.foldl (\d -> AOC.gSet (doorPos d loc) "  ")
                (AOC.gSet (roomPos loc) ((Dict.get loc distances |> Maybe.withDefault -1 |> String.fromInt) ++ " " |> String.left 2) grd)
                connected
        )
        grid
        rooms
```
