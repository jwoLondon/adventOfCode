# Day 16 (2016): Dragon Checksum

'Part One' and 'Part Two' puzzle descriptions and puzzle input from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2016/day/16).

{( part1|}

The first disk you have to fill has length 272. Using the initial state in your puzzle input, **what is the correct checksum**?

{| part1 )}

```elm {l r}
part1 : Int
part1 =
    0
```

{( part2 |}

The second disk you have to fill has length 35651584. Again using the initial state in your puzzle input, **what is the correct checksum** for this disk?

{| part2 )}

```elm {l r}
part2 : Int
part2 =
    0
```
