# Day 4 (2016): Security Through Obscurity

'Part One' and 'Part Two' puzzle descriptions and puzzle input from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2016/day/4):

{( part1|}

What is the **sum of the sector IDs of the real rooms**?

{| part1 )}

We can start by parsing the input data in order to separate the name from its sector id and checksum:

```elm {l}
type alias Room =
    { name : String
    , id : Int
    , checksum : String
    }


parse : List String -> List Room
parse =
    let
        parseLine text rooms =
            case AOC.submatches "(.+)-(\\d+)\\[(.+)\\]" text of
                [ Just name, Just id, Just checksum ] ->
                    Room name (AOC.toInt id) checksum :: rooms

                _ ->
                    rooms
    in
    List.foldl parseLine []
```

To find the commonest five letters, we can create a frequency table of the letters after removing the dashes, sort it by frequency and extract the top five keys:

```elm {l}
top5 : String -> String
top5 =
    let
        customSort ( c1, f1 ) ( c2, f2 ) =
            case compare f1 f2 of
                LT ->
                    GT

                GT ->
                    LT

                EQ ->
                    compare c1 c2
    in
    String.toList
        >> List.filter ((/=) '-')
        >> List.foldl AOC.addToFreqTable Dict.empty
        >> Dict.toList
        >> List.sortWith customSort
        >> List.take 5
        >> List.map Tuple.first
        >> String.fromList
```

```elm {l r}
part1 : Int
part1 =
    puzzleInput
        |> parse
        |> List.filter (\r -> top5 r.name == r.checksum)
        |> List.map .id
        |> List.sum
```

{( part2 |}

**What is the sector ID** of the room where North Pole objects are stored?

{| part2 )}

A 'Caesar' shift-cypher is easy to decode with modulus 26 arithmetic :

```elm {l}
decrypt : Int -> String -> String
decrypt shifts =
    let
        aCode =
            Char.toCode 'a'

        decryptChar char =
            if char == '-' then
                ' '

            else
                modBy 26 (Char.toCode char - aCode + shifts) + aCode |> Char.fromCode
    in
    String.toList
        >> List.map decryptChar
        >> String.fromList
```

To find the sector ID of the room where north pole objects are stored we can display the decrypted names and their IDs, filtering only those with a relevant terms. Quick trial and error reveals that `north` is a suitable filtering term:

```elm {l r}
part2 : List ( Int, String )
part2 =
    puzzleInput
        |> parse
        |> List.filter (\r -> top5 r.name == r.checksum)
        |> List.filter (\r -> decrypt r.id r.name |> String.contains "north")
        |> List.map (\r -> ( r.id, decrypt r.id r.name ))
```

## Reflection

Although a relatively simple problem, it does involve several steps. Extracting the top 5 terms by frequency was a little more cumbersome that expected as there is no simple way in Elm for stable sorting a dictionary by value (frequency) rather than key (letter). This required a custom stable sort (`top5`).

Part 2 was unusual in that the specification of the answer was not precisely defined "What is the sector ID of the room where North Pole objects are stored?‚Äù. Outside of AoC, especially in visualization, this is not uncommon in tackling a problem where there is a degree of exploration required to fully understand what is required of the computation.
