# Day 3 (2016): Squares With Three Sides

'Part One' and 'Part Two' puzzle descriptions and puzzle input from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2016/day/3).

{( part1|}

In your puzzle input, **how many** of the listed triangles are **possible**?

{| part1 )}

Each triangle is conveniently stored in a 3-tuple:

```elm {l}
type alias Tri =
    ( Int, Int, Int )
```

We can extract the side lengths of each triangle with some simple parsing

```elm {l}
parse : String -> Tri
parse =
    let
        toTriplet ss =
            case ss of
                [ s1, s2, s3 ] ->
                    ( AOC.toInt s1, AOC.toInt s2, AOC.toInt s3 )

                _ ->
                    ( 0, 0, 0 )
    in
    AOC.match "(\\d+)" >> toTriplet
```

To test if a triplet could represent a real triangle, we could sort side lengths and check the sum of the shortest two is greater than the longest one, or more simply test all combinations:

```elm {l}
isTriangle : Tri -> Bool
isTriangle ( l1, l2, l3 ) =
    l1 + l2 > l3 && l1 + l3 > l2 && l2 + l3 > l1
```

And to count the number of valid triangles we just filter based on our `isTriangle` test:

```elm {l r}
part1 : Int
part1 =
    puzzleInput
        |> List.map parse
        |> List.filter isTriangle
        |> List.length
```

{( part2 |}

In your puzzle input, and instead reading by columns, how many of the listed triangles are possible?

{| part2 )}

This is pretty much the same as part one except that we first need to transpose the input in groups of 9:

```elm {l}
transpose9 : List Tri -> List Tri
transpose9 tris =
    case tris of
        ( a1, a2, a3 ) :: ( b1, b2, b3 ) :: ( c1, c2, c3 ) :: tl ->
            ( a1, b1, c1 )
                :: ( a2, b2, c2 )
                :: ( a3, b3, c3 )
                :: transpose9 tl

        _ ->
            tris
```

```elm {l r}
part2 : Int
part2 =
    puzzleInput
        |> List.map parse
        |> transpose9
        |> List.filter isTriangle
        |> List.length
```

## Reflection

A nice simple problem well suited to a functional approach and pattern matching in lists.
