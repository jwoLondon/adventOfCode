# Day 25 (2016): Clock Signal

'Part One' puzzle description and puzzle input from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2016/day/25):

{( part1|}

**What is the lowest positive integer** that can be used to initialize register a and cause the code to output a clock signal of 0, 1, 0, 1... repeating forever?

{| part1 )}

```elm {l r}
part1 : Int
part1 =
    0
```
