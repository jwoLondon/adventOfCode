# Day 15 (2016): Timing is Everything

'Part One' and 'Part Two' puzzle descriptions and puzzle input from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2016/day/15).

{( part1|}

However, your situation has more than two discs; you've noted their positions in your puzzle input. What is the **first time you can press the button** to get a capsule?

{| part1 )}

```elm {l r}
part1 : Int
part1 =
    0
```

{( part2 |}

With this new disc, and counting again starting from time=0 with the configuration in your puzzle input, what is the **first time you can press the button** to get another capsule?

{| part2 )}

```elm {l r}
part2 : Int
part2 =
    0
```
