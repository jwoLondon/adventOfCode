# Day 10 (2016): Balance Bots

'Part One' and 'Part Two' puzzle descriptions and puzzle input from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2016/day/10):

{( part1|}

Based on your instructions, **what is the number of the bot** that is responsible for comparing value-61 microchips with value-17 microchips?

{| part1 )}

```elm {l r}
part1 : Int
part1 =
    0
```

{( part2 |}

What do you get if you **multiply together the values** of one chip in each of outputs 0, 1, and 2?

{| part2 )}

```elm {l r}
part2 : Int
part2 =
    0
```
