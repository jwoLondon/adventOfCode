# Day 14 (2016): One-Time Pad

'Part One' and 'Part Two' puzzle descriptions and puzzle input from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2016/day/14).

{( part1|}

Given the actual salt in your puzzle input, **what index** produces your 64th one-time pad key?

{| part1 )}

```elm {l r}
part1 : Int
part1 =
    0
```

{( part2 |}

Given the actual salt in your puzzle input and using 2016 extra MD5 calls of key stretching, **what index** now produces your 64th one-time pad key?

{| part2 )}

```elm {l r}
part2 : Int
part2 =
    0
```
