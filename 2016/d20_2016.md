# Day 20 (2016): Firewall Rules

'Part One' and 'Part Two' puzzle descriptions and puzzle input from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2016/day/20).

{( part1|}

Given the list of blocked IPs you retrieved from the firewall (your puzzle input), **what is the lowest-valued IP** that is not blocked?

{| part1 )}

```elm {l r}
part1 : Int
part1 =
    0
```

{( part2 |}

**How many IPs** are allowed by the blacklist?

{| part2 )}

```elm {l r}
part2 : Int
part2 =
    0
```
