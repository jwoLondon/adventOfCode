# Day 18 (2016): Like a Rogue

'Part One' and 'Part Two' puzzle descriptions and puzzle input from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2016/day/18).

{( part1|}

Starting with the map in your puzzle input, in a total of 40 rows (including the starting row), **how many safe tiles** are there?

{| part1 )}

```elm {l r}
part1 : Int
part1 =
    0
```

{( part2 |}

**How many safe tiles** are there in a total of 400000 rows?

{| part2 )}

```elm {l r}
part2 : Int
part2 =
    0
```
