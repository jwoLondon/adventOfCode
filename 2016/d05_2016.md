# Day 5 (2016): How About a Nice Game of Chess?

'Part One' and 'Part Two' puzzle descriptions and puzzle input from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2016/day/5).

{( part1|}

Given the actual Door ID, **what is the password**?

{| part1 )}

To solve this puzzle we need an MD5 hashing package. MD5Fast (see [src/MD5Fast.elm](src/MD5Fast.elm)) does this although it is much slower than the built-in Java MD5 hashing.

To start, we need to find zero hashes by incrementing possible values until at 5 zeros are found in the first 5 characters of the hashed value:

```elm {l}
findNextZeroHash : String -> Int -> Int
findNextZeroHash key index =
    let
        hash =
            key ++ String.fromInt index |> MD5.hex
    in
    if String.left 5 hash == "00000" then
        index

    else
        findNextZeroHash key (index + 1)
```

```elm {l}
password : Int -> List Char -> String -> List Char
password index pwd key =
    if List.length pwd >= 8 then
        pwd

    else
        let
            zIndex =
                findNextZeroHash key index
        in
        password (zIndex + 1) (pwd ++ pwdDigit key zIndex) key


pwdDigit : String -> Int -> List Char
pwdDigit key index =
    MD5.hex (key ++ String.fromInt index)
        |> String.slice 5 6
        |> String.toList
```

```elm {l m}
part1 : String
part1 =
    -- password 1 [] puzzleInput |>
    -- Commented out to speed up display of formatted output (uncoment to recalculate)
    [ '8', '0', '1', 'b', '5', '6', 'a', '7' ]
        |> String.fromList
```

{( part2 |}

Given the actual Door ID and this new method, **what is the password**?

{| part2 )}

This is largely similar to part 1 except that we need to keep a record of which positions have been found so as not to overwrite them with new hashes. We can use a dictionary to store completed positions and only update it if a given position is absent from the dictionary. The task is complete when the size of dictionary is 8.

```elm {l}
addDigit : ( Int, Char ) -> Dict Int Char -> Dict Int Char
addDigit ( pos, chr ) pwd =
    if Dict.member pos pwd then
        pwd

    else
        Dict.insert pos chr pwd
```

```elm {l}
pwdDigit2 : String -> Int -> ( Maybe Int, Char )
pwdDigit2 key index =
    let
        chrs =
            MD5.hex (key ++ String.fromInt index)
                |> String.slice 5 7
                |> String.toList
    in
    case chrs of
        [ pos, chr ] ->
            if pos >= '0' && pos < '8' then
                ( pos |> String.fromChar |> String.toInt, chr )

            else
                ( Nothing, ' ' )

        _ ->
            ( Nothing, ' ' )
```

```elm {l}
password2 : Int -> Dict Int Char -> String -> Dict Int Char
password2 index pwd key =
    if Dict.size pwd >= 8 then
        pwd

    else
        let
            zIndex =
                findNextZeroHash key index
        in
        case pwdDigit2 key zIndex of
            ( Just pos, chr ) ->
                password2 (zIndex + 1) (addDigit ( pos, chr ) pwd) key

            _ ->
                password2 (zIndex + 1) pwd key
```

```elm {l r}
part2 : String
part2 =
    -- password2 1 Dict.empty puzzleInput
    --     |> Dict.values
    -- Commented out to speed up display of formatted output (uncoment to recalculate)
    [ '4', '2', '4', 'a', '0', '9', '7' ]
        |> String.fromList
```

## Reflection

Very similar to [Day 4, 2015](../2015/d04_2015.md), MD5 hashing puzzles are a little frustrating in Elm simply because the hashing algorithm is quite slow. The puzzle itself is pretty straightforward.
