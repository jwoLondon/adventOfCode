# Day 6 (2016): Signals and Noise

'Part One' and 'Part Two' puzzle descriptions and puzzle input from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2016/day/6).

{( part1|}

Given the recording in your puzzle input, **what is the error-corrected version** of the message being sent?

{| part1 )}

As we can process columns independently we can simply build a letter frequency table column at a time. We can transpose the original list of strings to process columns as lists of characters and use the AoC built-in mode function for finding the most common letter in each.

```elm {l r}
part1 : String
part1 =
    puzzleInput
        |> List.map String.toList
        |> AOC.transpose
        |> List.map AOC.mode
        |> List.filterMap identity
        |> String.fromList
```

{( part2 |}

Given the recording in your puzzle input and this new decoding methodology, **what is the original message** that Santa is trying to send?

{| part2 )}

Almost identical to the first part except that we need to find the least common letter so need to adapt the `mode` function to do this.

```elm {l}
leastCommon : List comparable -> Maybe comparable
leastCommon =
    List.foldl AOC.addToFreqTable Dict.empty
        >> Dict.toList
        >> List.map (\( a, b ) -> ( b, a ))
        >> List.sort
        >> List.map Tuple.second
        >> List.head
```

```elm {l r}
part2 : String
part2 =
    puzzleInput
        |> List.map String.toList
        |> AOC.transpose
        |> List.map leastCommon
        |> List.filterMap identity
        |> String.fromList
```

## Reflection

A nice simple puzzle that encourages thinking about elegant solutions. Initially I was tempted to create a single frequency table for storing all columns in the puzzle input, but it soon became clear this was not necessary nor particularly elegant. Reusing existing `transpose` and `mode` functions keeps code clear and compact.
