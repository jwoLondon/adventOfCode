# Day 12 (2016): Leonardo's Monorail

'Part One' and 'Part Two' puzzle descriptions and puzzle input from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2016/day/12).

{( part1|}

After executing the assembunny code in your puzzle input, **what value is left in register a?**

{| part1 )}

```elm {l r}
part1 : Int
part1 =
    0
```

{( part2 |}

If you instead **initialize register c to be 1**, what value is now left in register a?

{| part2 )}

```elm {l r}
part2 : Int
part2 =
    0
```
