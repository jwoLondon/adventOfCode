# Day 16 (2015): Aunt Sue

'Part One' and 'Part Two' puzzle descriptions and puzzle input from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/16).

{( part1|}

What is the number of the Sue that got you the gift?

{| part1 )}

## Data structures

Each 'Sue' has a name and a series of characteristics you remember about her. Each 'characterstic' comprises a thing (e.g. goldfish) and a count of the number of those things. So let's provide a data structure for capturing that information:

```elm {l}
type alias Sue =
    { name : String
    , characteristics : Dict String Int
    }
```

We can now represent the Sue detected by My First Crime Scene Analysis Machine:

```elm {l}
donor : Sue
donor =
    [ ( "children", 3 ), ( "cats", 7 ), ( "samoyeds", 2 ), ( "pomeranians", 3 ), ( "akitas", 0 ), ( "vizslas", 0 ), ( "goldfish", 5 ), ( "trees", 3 ), ( "cars", 2 ), ( "perfumes", 1 ) ]
        |> List.foldl (\( thing, count ) -> Dict.insert thing count) Dict.empty
        |> Sue "donor"
```

In order to detect whether any given Sue is the donor Sue, we can compare known characteristics:

```elm {l}
couldBe : Sue -> Sue -> Bool
couldBe sueA sueB =
    let
        couldMatch characteristics characteristic count =
            case Dict.get characteristic characteristics of
                Nothing ->
                    True

                Just numItems ->
                    numItems == count

        matched =
            Dict.filter (couldMatch sueB.characteristics) sueA.characteristics
    in
    Dict.size matched == Dict.size sueA.characteristics
```

We can now parse the input, extracting the Sue characteristics and checking to see if each could be the donor:

```elm {l}
parse : List String -> List Sue
parse =
    let
        regex =
            "(Sue \\d+): (\\w+): (\\d+)[,] (\\w+): (\\d+)[,] (\\w+): (\\d+)"

        parseLine text sues =
            case AOC.submatches regex text of
                [ Just name, Just t1, Just n1, Just t2, Just n2, Just t3, Just n3 ] ->
                    addSue name
                        [ ( t1, AOC.toInt n1 )
                        , ( t2, AOC.toInt n2 )
                        , ( t3, AOC.toInt n3 )
                        ]
                        :: sues

                _ ->
                    sues
    in
    List.foldl parseLine []


addSue : String -> List ( String, Int ) -> Sue
addSue name =
    List.foldl (\( thing, count ) -> Dict.insert thing count) Dict.empty
        >> Sue name
```

```elm {l r}
part1 : List String
part1 =
    puzzleInput
        |> parse
        |> List.filter (couldBe donor)
        |> List.map .name
```

{( part2 |}

What is the number of the real Aunt Sue?

{| part2 )}

The only different for the second part is that we have to use a modified `couldBe` to account for the new rules:

```elm {l}
couldBe2 : Sue -> Sue -> Bool
couldBe2 sueA sueB =
    let
        couldMatch characteristics characteristic count =
            case Dict.get characteristic characteristics of
                Nothing ->
                    True

                Just numItems ->
                    case characteristic of
                        "cat" ->
                            numItems > count

                        "trees" ->
                            numItems > count

                        "pomeranians" ->
                            numItems < count

                        "goldfish" ->
                            numItems < count

                        _ ->
                            numItems == count

        matched =
            Dict.filter (couldMatch sueB.characteristics) sueA.characteristics
    in
    Dict.size matched == Dict.size sueA.characteristics
```

```elm {l r}
part2 : List String
part2 =
    puzzleInput
        |> parse
        |> List.filter (couldBe2 donor)
        |> List.map .name
```
