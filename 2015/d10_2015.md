# Day 10 (2015): Elves Look, Elves Say

'Part One' and 'Part Two' puzzle descriptions and puzzle input from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/10).

{( part1|}

Starting with the digits in your puzzle input, apply this process 40 times. **What is the length of the result?**

{| part1 )}

Text decoding looks like a job for regex, so let's create a regular expression for replacing a 'look' with a 'say'.
The search regex says match as many repeated digits as exist in a consecutive sequence.
The replace function counts the number of repeats and adds the digit that is being repeated.

```elm {l}
say : String -> String
say =
    AOC.replaceFn "(\\d)\\1*"
        (\m -> (String.length m.match |> String.fromInt) ++ String.left 1 m.match)
```

We can iteratively apply the replace as many times as required by the question before measuring its length:

```elm {l r}
part1 : Int
part1 =
    AOC.iterate 40 puzzleInput say |> String.length
```

{( part2 |}

Now, starting again with the digits in your puzzle input, apply this process 50 times. What is the length of the new result?

{| part2 )}

This just requires changing the number of iterations, noting that the size grows non-linearly with the number of iterations.

```elm {l r}
part2 : Int
part2 =
    AOC.iterate 50 puzzleInput say |> String.length
```
