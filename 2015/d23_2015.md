# Day 23 (2015): Opening the Turing Lock

'Part One' and 'Part Two' puzzle descriptions and puzzle input from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/23).

{( part1|}

**What is the value in register b when the program in your puzzle input is finished executing?**

{| part1 )}

## Data Structures

The two registers can be represented as a dictionary (allowing a greater number of registers to be used if we needed to) and a custom type to define the instruction set.

The program itself (parsed from the puzzle input data) is conveniently represented with an Array as we will need to make random-access jumps to different parts of it in response to the three jump instructions.

```elm {l}
type alias Registers =
    Dict Char Int


type Instruction
    = Hlf Char
    | Tpl Char
    | Inc Char
    | Jmp Int
    | Jie Char Int
    | Jio Char Int
```

## Parsing Input

A regex can be used to capture all possibilities of the limited instruction set. Frome this we can transform to custom types and build the program to run.

```elm {l}
parse : List String -> Array Instruction
parse =
    let
        toChar =
            String.toList >> List.head >> Maybe.withDefault 'X'

        parseLine text instructions =
            case AOC.submatches "(\\w+) ([ab]|[+-]\\d+)(?:, )?([+-]\\d+)?" text of
                [ Just "hlf", Just reg, Nothing ] ->
                    Hlf (toChar reg) :: instructions

                [ Just "tpl", Just reg, Nothing ] ->
                    Tpl (toChar reg) :: instructions

                [ Just "inc", Just reg, Nothing ] ->
                    Inc (toChar reg) :: instructions

                [ Just "jmp", Just offset, Nothing ] ->
                    Jmp (AOC.toInt offset) :: instructions

                [ Just "jie", Just reg, Just offset ] ->
                    Jie (toChar reg) (AOC.toInt offset) :: instructions

                [ Just "jio", Just reg, Just offset ] ->
                    Jio (toChar reg) (AOC.toInt offset) :: instructions

                _ ->
                    instructions
    in
    List.foldl parseLine [] >> List.reverse >> Array.fromList
```

## Approach

This is a fairly simple puzzle which we can solve by keeping a pointer to the current instruction in an array of instructions and processing the instruction at the pointer location. We continue to jump to locations in the array until an instruction takes us out of bounds (generating a `Nothing` when attempting to get a value from the array), at which point we halt and examine register b.

```elm {l}
run : Int -> Registers -> Array Instruction -> Registers
run pos registers program =
    let
        get regName =
            Dict.get regName registers |> Maybe.withDefault 0
    in
    case Array.get pos program of
        Just (Hlf reg) ->
            run (pos + 1) (Dict.insert reg (get reg // 2) registers) program

        Just (Tpl reg) ->
            run (pos + 1) (Dict.insert reg (get reg * 3) registers) program

        Just (Inc reg) ->
            run (pos + 1) (Dict.insert reg (get reg + 1) registers) program

        Just (Jmp offset) ->
            run (pos + offset) registers program

        Just (Jie reg offset) ->
            if modBy 2 (get reg) == 0 then
                run (pos + offset) registers program

            else
                run (pos + 1) registers program

        Just (Jio reg offset) ->
            if get reg == 1 then
                run (pos + offset) registers program

            else
                run (pos + 1) registers program

        Nothing ->
            registers
```

```elm {l r}
part1 : Int
part1 =
    puzzleInput
        |> parse
        |> run 0 (Dict.fromList [ ( 'a', 0 ), ( 'b', 0 ) ])
        |> Dict.get 'b'
        |> Maybe.withDefault 0
```

{( part2 |}

What is the value in register b after the program is finished executing if register a starts as 1 instead?

{| part2 )}

We just need to initialise the register `a` with a 1 and run the same program:

```elm {l r}
part2 : Int
part2 =
    puzzleInput
        |> parse
        |> run 0 (Dict.fromList [ ( 'a', 1 ), ( 'b', 0 ) ])
        |> Dict.get 'b'
        |> Maybe.withDefault 0
```

## Reflection

There is something satisfying in building an assembly-language interpreter, even if it is as simple as the one specified in the question. Using custom types keeps the code clean and provides a template for future extensions to the language (assembunny code in 2016).
