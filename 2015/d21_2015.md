# Day 21 (2015): RPG Simulator 20XX

'Part One' and 'Part Two' puzzle descriptions and puzzle input from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/21).

{( part1|}

You have 100 hit points. The boss's actual stats are in your puzzle input. What is the least amount of gold you can spend and still win the fight?

{| part1 )}

## Data Structures

We will first create simple records for representing items (swords, rings etc.) and players' attributes (hit points, damage etc.). While we could create lists holding these characteristics, the code is more readable if we use records with named entities:

```elm {l}
type alias Item =
    { name : String
    , cost : Int
    , dam : Int
    , def : Int
    }


type alias Character =
    { hp : Int
    , dam : Int
    , def : Int
    , spent : Int
    }
```

It then becomes easy to create 'shops' from which items may be purchased with clear to read code. Because we can only purchase one weapon or armour at most, we only need to stock the shops with one of each. For optional items like armour and rings, we can create a 'dummy' items with no attributes (`Naked`, `NoRingL` and `NoRingR`). This simplifies things as we then always purchase the same number of items from the shop with the dummies acting as a 'no purchase'.

```elm {l}
weaponStore : List Item
weaponStore =
    [ Item "Dagger" 8 4 0
    , Item "Shortsword" 10 5 0
    , Item "Warhammer" 25 6 0
    , Item "Longsword" 40 7 0
    , Item "Greataxe" 74 8 0
    ]


armourStore : List Item
armourStore =
    [ Item "Naked" 0 0 0
    , Item "Leather" 13 0 1
    , Item "Chainmail" 31 0 2
    , Item "Splintmail" 53 0 3
    , Item "Bandedmail" 75 0 4
    , Item "Platemail" 102 0 5
    ]


ringStore : List Item
ringStore =
    [ Item "NoRingL" 0 0 0
    , Item "NoRingR" 0 0 0
    , Item "Damage1" 25 1 0
    , Item "Damage2" 50 2 0
    , Item "Damage3" 100 3 0
    , Item "Defence1" 20 0 1
    , Item "Defence2" 40 0 2
    , Item "Defence3" 80 0 3
    ]
```

## Equipping the Boss

The Boss's stats are provided by the puzzle input:

```elm  {l}
parse : List String -> Character
parse =
    let
        parseLine text bossStat =
            case AOC.submatches "(\\w+ *\\w+): (\\d+)" text of
                [ Just "Hit Points", Just p ] ->
                    { bossStat | hp = AOC.toInt p }

                [ Just "Damage", Just d ] ->
                    { bossStat | dam = AOC.toInt d }

                [ Just "Armor", Just a ] ->
                    { bossStat | def = AOC.toInt a }

                _ ->
                    bossStat
    in
    List.foldl parseLine (Character 0 0 0 0)
```

## Equipping The Player

The approach to solving the problem is to try every combination of valid purchases from the shops, which results in a list of players each with different characteristics, and then play the game against the Boss for each to see who wins.

```elm {l}
players : List Character
players =
    equip weaponStore armourStore ringStore


equip : List Item -> List Item -> List Item -> List Character
equip weapons armour rings =
    let
        score item character =
            { character
                | dam = character.dam + item.dam
                , def = character.def + item.def
                , spent = character.spent + item.cost
            }

        equipPlayer items =
            List.foldl score (Character 100 0 0 0) items
    in
    AOC.combinations 2 rings
        |> List.concatMap (\n -> List.map (\x -> x :: n) armour)
        |> List.concatMap (\n -> List.map (\x -> x :: n) weapons)
        |> List.map equipPlayer
```

To find who from a pair of characters has won a game, just calculate who can last the longest before they die:

```elm {l}
playerWins : Character -> Character -> Bool
playerWins boss player =
    let
        bossMovesToDie =
            toFloat boss.hp / toFloat (max 1 (player.dam - boss.def))

        playerMovesToDie =
            toFloat player.hp / toFloat (max 1 (boss.dam - player.def))
    in
    playerMovesToDie > bossMovesToDie
```

And finally, from the list of matches won by the player, we find the one with that required the smallest outlay of gold:

```elm {l r}
part1 : Maybe Int
part1 =
    let
        boss =
            parse puzzleInput
    in
    players
        |> List.filter (playerWins boss)
        |> List.map .spent
        |> List.minimum
```

{( part2 |}

What is the most amount of gold you can spend and still lose the fight?

{| part2 )}

This is a simple inversion of the success criteria where we now find the maximum gold outlay from all the outcomes that involved the player losing:

```elm {l r}
part2 : Maybe Int
part2 =
    let
        boss =
            parse puzzleInput
    in
    players
        |> List.filter (not << playerWins boss)
        |> List.map .spent
        |> List.maximum
```

## Reflection

Quite a satisfying problem to code up in a functional language as this is the kind of problem that more would naturally lend itself to an object-oriented approach. A key insight was that I didn't have to iterate through all the rounds of each game, as the final outcome could be predicted as a function of the player stats (see `playerWins`). Thinking functionally helped me to see this rather than a more procedural churning though each game.
