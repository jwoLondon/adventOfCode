# Day 1 (2015): Not Quite Lisp

'Part One' and 'Part Two' puzzle descriptions and puzzle input from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/1).

{( part1|}

To what floor do the instructions take Santa?

{| part1 )}

We can change a given floor depending on the symbol:

```elm {l}
moveFloor : Char -> Int -> Int
moveFloor instruction floor =
    if instruction == '(' then
        floor + 1

    else
        floor - 1
```

And then simply apply this function to each symbol in the input text:

```elm {l r}
part1 : Int
part1 =
    puzzleInput |> String.toList |> List.foldl moveFloor 0
```

{( part2 |}

What is the position of the character that causes Santa to first enter the basement?

{| part2 )}

Similar to part one, but this time we create a list of floor positions and find the first instance of floor -1.

```elm {l r}
part2 : Int
part2 =
    puzzleInput |> String.toList |> AOC.scanl moveFloor 0 |> AOC.indexOf -1
```
