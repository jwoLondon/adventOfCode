# Day 22 (2015): Wizard Simulator 20XX

'Part One' and 'Part Two' puzzle descriptions and puzzle input from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/22).

{( part1|}

You start with **50 hit points** and **500 mana points**. The boss's actual stats are in your puzzle input. What is the **least amount of mana** you can spend and still win the fight? (Do not include mana recharge effects as "spending" negative mana.)

{| part1 )}

```elm {l r}
part1 : Int
part1 =
    0
```

{( part2 |}

With the same starting stats for you and the boss, what is the **least amount of mana** you can spend and still win the fight?

{| part2 )}

```elm {l r}
part2 : Int
part2 =
    0
```
