# Day 15 (2015): Science for Hungry People

'Part One' and 'Part Two' puzzle descriptions and puzzle input from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/15).

{( part1|}

Given the ingredients in your kitchen and their properties, what is the total score of the highest-scoring cookie you can make?

{| part1 )}

## Data structure and Parsing

As with most questions, let's start with providing a data structure to store the relevant input data.
In this case we need to be able to store the ingredient properties that we will need to calcualte the 'score' of each combination of ingredients:

```elm {l}
type alias Ingredient =
    { cap : Int
    , dur : Int
    , fla : Int
    , tex : Int
    , cal : Int
    }
```

We can parse the input data containing the ingredients and their properties:

```elm {l}
parse : List String -> List Ingredient
parse =
    let
        parseLine : String -> List Ingredient -> List Ingredient
        parseLine text ingredients =
            let
                regex =
                    "\\w+: capacity (-?\\d+), durability (-?\\d+), flavor (-?\\d+), texture (-?\\d+), calories (-?\\d+)"
            in
            case AOC.submatches regex text of
                [ Just cap, Just dur, Just fla, Just tex, Just cal ] ->
                    ingredients
                        ++ [ Ingredient
                                (AOC.toInt cap)
                                (AOC.toInt dur)
                                (AOC.toInt fla)
                                (AOC.toInt tex)
                                (AOC.toInt cal)
                           ]

                _ ->
                    ingredients
    in
    List.foldl parseLine []
```

## Approach

This is a version of the [knapsack problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem) and involves finding all the permutations of ingredients that could sum to 100.

Any one recipe will contain a list of ingredient properties scaled by the number of teaspoons of each ingredient. From this we can calculate its score:

```elm {l}
type alias Properties =
    List (List Int)


totalScore : Properties -> List Int -> Int
totalScore allProps quantities =
    let
        propScore q props =
            List.map2 (*) props q |> List.sum |> max 0
    in
    List.map (propScore quantities) allProps |> List.product
```

We now have to permute all possible ingredients such that they sum to 100 teaspoons:

```elm {l}
permute : Properties -> Int -> Int -> List Int -> Int -> Int
permute allProps qToFind unallocated quantities maxScore =
    if qToFind == 1 then
        max maxScore <|
            totalScore allProps (unallocated :: quantities)

    else
        next allProps (qToFind - 1) unallocated 0 quantities maxScore


next : Properties -> Int -> Int -> Int -> List Int -> Int -> Int
next allProps qToFind unallocated allocated quantities maxScore =
    let
        newMax =
            max maxScore <|
                permute allProps qToFind unallocated (allocated :: quantities) maxScore
    in
    if unallocated > 0 then
        max maxScore <|
            next allProps qToFind (unallocated - 1) (allocated + 1) quantities newMax

    else
        newMax
```

```elm {l r}
part1 : Int
part1 =
    let
        ingredients =
            parse puzzleInput

        allProps =
            List.map (\i -> [ i.cap, i.dur, i.fla, i.tex ]) ingredients
                |> AOC.transpose
    in
    permute allProps (ingredients |> List.length) 100 [] 0
```

{( part2 |}

Given the ingredients in your kitchen and their properties, what is the total score of the highest-scoring cookie you can make with a calorie total of 500?

{| part2 )}

This modification to the problem requires us to account for the calorific property of each ingredient and ensure it sums to 500.

```elm {l}
totalScore2 : Properties -> List Int -> List Int -> Int
totalScore2 allProps calories quantities =
    let
        propScore q props =
            List.map2 (*) props q |> List.sum |> max 0
    in
    if propScore quantities calories == 500 then
        List.map (propScore quantities) allProps |> List.product

    else
        0
```

And the permutations of ingredients now need to account for calorific content:

```elm {l}
permute2 : Properties -> List Int -> Int -> Int -> List Int -> Int -> Int
permute2 allProps calories qToFind unallocated quantities maxScore =
    if qToFind == 1 then
        max maxScore <|
            totalScore2 allProps calories (unallocated :: quantities)

    else
        next2 allProps calories (qToFind - 1) unallocated 0 quantities maxScore


next2 : Properties -> List Int -> Int -> Int -> Int -> List Int -> Int -> Int
next2 allProps calories qToFind unallocated allocated quantities maxScore =
    let
        newMax =
            max maxScore <|
                permute2 allProps calories qToFind unallocated (allocated :: quantities) maxScore
    in
    if unallocated > 0 then
        max maxScore <|
            next2 allProps calories qToFind (unallocated - 1) (allocated + 1) quantities newMax

    else
        newMax
```

```elm {l r}
part2 : Int
part2 =
    let
        ingredients =
            parse puzzleInput

        allProps =
            List.map (\i -> [ i.cap, i.dur, i.fla, i.tex ]) ingredients
                |> AOC.transpose

        cals =
            List.map (\i -> i.cal) ingredients
    in
    permute2 allProps cals (ingredients |> List.length) 100 [] 0
```
