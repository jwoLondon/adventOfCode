# Day 18 (2015): Like a GIF For Your Yard

'Part One' and 'Part Two' puzzle descriptions and puzzle input from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/18).

{( part1|}

In your grid of 100x100 lights, given your initial configuration, **how many lights are on after 100 steps?**

{| part1 )}

## Data Structures and Parsing

As with the similar [day 6, 2015 puzzle](d06_2015.md), we can represent lights as an array allowing us to query the state of the light at any arbitrary location. The only change is that we will be considering the neighbours of bordering cells (which are assumed to be 'off'), so we make minor modification to `lightAt`.

```elm {l}
type alias Lights =
    Array Int


type alias Location =
    ( Int, Int )


parse : List Char -> Lights
parse =
    let
        digits chr =
            case chr of
                '#' ->
                    1

                _ ->
                    0
    in
    List.map digits >> Array.fromList


gridSize : Int
gridSize =
    100


lightAt : Location -> Lights -> Int
lightAt ( x, y ) =
    if (x < 0) || (y < 0) || (x >= gridSize) || (y >= gridSize) then
        always 0

    else
        Array.get (y * gridSize + x) >> Maybe.withDefault 0


setLight : Location -> Int -> Lights -> Lights
setLight ( x, y ) value =
    Array.set (y * gridSize + x) value
```

## Cellular Automata

The puzzle requires us to implement a [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life), applying simple rules to the on/off status of each light depending on the number of its neighbours that are on.
We could provide a simple function that reports the number of neighbouring lights that are on:

```elm {l siding}
numNeighbours : Location -> Lights -> Int
numNeighbours ( x, y ) lights =
    lightAt ( x - 1, y - 1 ) lights
        + lightAt ( x, y - 1 ) lights
        + lightAt ( x + 1, y - 1 ) lights
        + lightAt ( x - 1, y ) lights
        + lightAt ( x + 1, y ) lights
        + lightAt ( x - 1, y + 1 ) lights
        + lightAt ( x, y + 1 ) lights
        + lightAt ( x + 1, y + 1 ) lights
```

In anticipation of the second part of the puzzle, we can create a modified version of the function that takes as its first parameter, the light querying function.
This will allow us to change how we test for light state by providing a different function should we need to:

```elm {l}
numNeighbours : (Location -> Lights -> Int) -> Location -> Lights -> Int
numNeighbours lightFn ( x, y ) lights =
    lightFn ( x - 1, y - 1 ) lights
        + lightFn ( x, y - 1 ) lights
        + lightFn ( x + 1, y - 1 ) lights
        + lightFn ( x - 1, y ) lights
        + lightFn ( x + 1, y ) lights
        + lightFn ( x - 1, y + 1 ) lights
        + lightFn ( x, y + 1 ) lights
        + lightFn ( x + 1, y + 1 ) lights
```

This makes it easy to apply the 'Game of Life' rules that determines the state of a light dependent on its neighbour count:

```elm {l}
evolvedCell : (Location -> Lights -> Int) -> Location -> Lights -> Int
evolvedCell lightFn location lights =
    let
        adj =
            numNeighbours lightFn location lights
    in
    if lightFn location lights == 1 then
        if adj == 2 || adj == 3 then
            1

        else
            0

    else if adj == 3 then
        1

    else
        0
```

This allows us to evolve all the cells in the entire grid.
We can recursively update the position of the cell to evolve until we have reached the final cell in the bottom-right corner:

```elm {l}
evolvedGrid : (Location -> Lights -> Int) -> Location -> Lights -> Lights -> Lights
evolvedGrid lightFn ( x, y ) prevLights newLights =
    let
        nextLocation ( col, row ) =
            if col < gridSize - 1 then
                ( col + 1, row )

            else
                ( 0, row + 1 )
    in
    if x >= gridSize || y >= gridSize then
        newLights

    else
        evolvedGrid lightFn
            (nextLocation ( x, y ))
            prevLights
            (setLight ( x, y ) (evolvedCell lightFn ( x, y ) prevLights) newLights)
```

Finally, we can evolve the grid a fixed number of times to solve the puzzle:

```elm {l}
evolve : (Location -> Lights -> Int) -> Int -> Lights -> Lights
evolve lightFn numEvolutions lights =
    let
        emptyGrid =
            Array.repeat (gridSize * gridSize) 0
    in
    if numEvolutions == 0 then
        lights

    else
        evolve lightFn (numEvolutions - 1) (evolvedGrid lightFn ( 0, 0 ) lights emptyGrid)
```

```elm {l r}
part1 : Int
part1 =
    puzzleInput |> parse |> evolve lightAt 100 |> Array.toList |> List.sum
```

{( part2 |}

In your grid of 100x100 lights, given your initial configuration, but with the four corners always in the on state, how many lights are on after 100 steps?

{| part2 )}

One way of minimising the code changes required for the second part is to modify `lightAt` so that if one of the corner light positions is queried, it always returns an 'on':

```elm {l}
lightAt2 : Location -> Lights -> Int
lightAt2 ( x, y ) =
    if (x < 0) || (y < 0) || (x >= gridSize) || (y >= gridSize) then
        always 0

    else if x == 0 && (y == 0 || y == gridSize - 1) then
        always 1

    else if x == gridSize - 1 && (y == 0 || y == gridSize - 1) then
        always 1

    else
        Array.get (y * gridSize + x) >> Maybe.withDefault 0
```

The final query of the lights array simply sums the values to count the number of on switches, so we must also ensure that the corner values are all set to 'on':

```elm {l r}
part2 : Int
part2 =
    puzzleInput
        |> parse
        |> evolve lightAt2 100
        |> setLight ( 0, 0 ) 1
        |> setLight ( 0, gridSize - 1 ) 1
        |> setLight ( gridSize - 1, 0 ) 1
        |> setLight ( gridSize - 1, gridSize - 1 ) 1
        |> Array.toList
        |> List.sum
```
