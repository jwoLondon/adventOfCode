# Day 6 (2015): Probably a Fire Hazard

'Part One' and 'Part Two' puzzle descriptions and puzzle input from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/6).

{( part1|}

After following the instructions, how many lights are lit?

{| part1 )}

Any location within the grid of lights can be defined with two coordinates. The grid itself can be represented as a 1d array with functions to translate from 2d location to position in the 1d array:

```elm {l}
type alias Lights =
    Array Int


gridSize : Int
gridSize =
    1000


type alias Location =
    ( Int, Int )


lightAt : Location -> Lights -> Int
lightAt ( x, y ) =
    Array.get (y * gridSize + x) >> Maybe.withDefault 0


setLight : Int -> Location -> Lights -> Lights
setLight value ( x, y ) =
    Array.set (y * gridSize + x) value


toggle : Location -> Lights -> Lights
toggle location lights =
    if lightAt location lights == 1 then
        setLight 0 location lights

    else
        setLight 1 location lights
```

We need to be able to extract all the locations within an arbitrary sub-rectangular region of the grid:

```elm {l}
getLocations : Location -> Location -> Location -> List Location -> List Location
getLocations ( left, top ) ( right, bottom ) ( x, y ) locations =
    if ( x, y ) == ( right, bottom ) then
        ( x, y ) :: locations

    else if x == right then
        getLocations ( left, top ) ( right, bottom ) ( left, y + 1 ) (( x, y ) :: locations)

    else
        getLocations ( left, top ) ( right, bottom ) ( x + 1, y ) (( x, y ) :: locations)
```

We can recognise that all instructions operate on rectangular areas of a grid defined by their top-left and bottom-right corners, so let's represent such an instruction as a record:

```elm {l}
type alias Instruction =
    { switch : Switch
    , tl : Location
    , br : Location
    }


type Switch
    = On
    | Off
    | Toggle
```

We can then parse input generating an `Instruction`:

```elm {l}
parse : String -> Maybe Instruction
parse instructText =
    let
        words =
            String.words instructText

        location locText =
            case String.split "," locText of
                [ a, b ] ->
                    ( AOC.toInt a, AOC.toInt b )

                _ ->
                    ( 0, 0 )
    in
    case words of
        [ "turn", "on", tl, "through", br ] ->
            Just (Instruction On (location tl) (location br))

        [ "turn", "off", tl, "through", br ] ->
            Just (Instruction Off (location tl) (location br))

        [ "toggle", tl, "through", br ] ->
            Just (Instruction Toggle (location tl) (location br))

        _ ->
            Nothing
```

We can apply any given instruction to the grid of lights:

```elm {l}
switchLights : Instruction -> Lights -> Lights
switchLights instruction lights =
    let
        locations =
            getLocations instruction.tl instruction.br instruction.tl []
    in
    case instruction.switch of
        On ->
            List.foldl (setLight 1) lights locations

        Off ->
            List.foldl (setLight 0) lights locations

        Toggle ->
            List.foldl toggle lights locations
```

And apply the full list of instructions to the grid:

```elm {l r}
part1 : Int
part1 =
    -- Uncomment to run (slow)
    -- List.filterMap parse puzzleInput
    --     |> List.foldl switchLights (Array.repeat (gridSize * gridSize) 0)
    --     |> Array.toList
    --     |> List.sum
    543903
```

{( part2 |}

What is the total brightness of all lights combined after following Santa's instructions?

{| part2 )}

The structure for this modified set of responses to instructions remains the same, but we just need to change the actions associated with `On`, `Off` and `Toggle`:

```elm {l}
changeLight : Int -> Location -> Lights -> Lights
changeLight change location lights =
    setLight (lightAt location lights |> (+) change |> max 0) location lights


switchLights2 : Instruction -> Lights -> Lights
switchLights2 instruction lights =
    let
        locations =
            getLocations instruction.tl instruction.br instruction.tl []
    in
    case instruction.switch of
        On ->
            List.foldl (changeLight 1) lights locations

        Off ->
            List.foldl (changeLight -1) lights locations

        Toggle ->
            List.foldl (changeLight 2) lights locations
```

```elm {l r}
part2 : Int
part2 =
    -- Uncomment to run (slow)
    -- List.filterMap parse puzzleInput
    --     |> List.foldl switchLights2 (Array.repeat (gridSize * gridSize) 0)
    --     |> Array.toList
    --     |> List.sum
    14687245
```
