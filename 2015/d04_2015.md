# Day 4 (2015): The Ideal Stocking Stuffer

'Part One' and 'Part Two' puzzle descriptions and puzzle input from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/4):

{( part1|}

Santa needs help mining some AdventCoins (very similar to bitcoins) to use as gifts for all the economically forward-thinking little girls and boys.

To do this, he needs to find MD5 hashes which, in hexadecimal, start with at least five zeroes. The input to the MD5 hash is some secret key (your puzzle input, given below) followed by a number in decimal. To mine AdventCoins, you must find Santa the lowest positive number (no leading zeroes: 1, 2, 3, ...) that produces such a hash.

For example:

- If your secret key is abcdef, the answer is 609043, because the MD5 hash of abcdef609043 starts with five zeroes (000001dbbfa...), and it is the lowest such number to do so.
- If your secret key is pqrstuv, the lowest number it combines with to make an MD5 hash starting with five zeroes is 1048970; that is, the MD5 hash of pqrstuv1048970 looks like 000006136ef....

{| part1 )}

MD5 hashing is slow in elm/JavaScript, but is sped up slightly with an optimised implementation included added to the general Advent of Code utilities (`src/MD5Fast.elm`)

For any given hash we can find the next one that has a given number of leading zeros.

```elm {l}
findNextZeroHash : Int -> Int -> String -> Int
findNextZeroHash numZeros num key =
    let
        hasLeadingZeros str =
            String.left numZeros str == String.left numZeros "00000000000000000000000"

        hash =
            key ++ String.fromInt num |> MD5.hex
    in
    if hasLeadingZeros hash then
        num

    else
        findNextZeroHash numZeros (num + 1) key
```

The first with 5 leading zeros

```elm {l r}
part1 : Int
part1 =
    -- uncomment to run (slow)
    --findNextZeroHash 5 1 puzzleInput
    346386
```

{( part2 |}

Now find one that starts with six zeroes.

{| part2 )}

```elm {l r}
part2 : Int
part2 =
    -- Uncomment to run (slow)
    --findNextZeroHash 6 1 puzzleInput
    9958218
```
