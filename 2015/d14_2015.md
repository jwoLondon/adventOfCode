# Day 14 (2015): Reindeer Olympics

'Part One' and 'Part Two' puzzle descriptions and puzzle input from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/14).

{( part1|}

Given the descriptions of each reindeer (in your puzzle input), after exactly 2503 seconds, **what distance has the winning reindeer traveled?**

{| part1 )}

## Data Structure and Parsing

We can store each reindeer's speed and endurance as a record and use regex to parse the data to populate them:

```elm {l}
type alias Reindeer =
    { speed : Int
    , duration : Int
    , rest : Int
    }


parse : List String -> List Reindeer
parse =
    let
        parseLine line =
            case AOC.submatches "(\\d+) km/s for (\\d+) seconds, but then must rest for (\\d+)" line of
                [ Just speed, Just duration, Just rest ] ->
                    (++) [ Reindeer (AOC.toInt speed) (AOC.toInt duration) (AOC.toInt rest) ]

                _ ->
                    identity
    in
    List.foldl parseLine []
```

## Running the race

Calculating how far a reindeer has moved after a given time is a simple arithmetic calculation:

```elm {l}
distanceAfter : Int -> Reindeer -> Int
distanceAfter time reindeer =
    let
        cycle =
            reindeer.duration + reindeer.rest
    in
    reindeer.speed * (reindeer.duration * (time // cycle) + min reindeer.duration (modBy cycle time))
```

And so the winner will be the reindeer that covers the greatest distance.

```elm {l r}
part1 : Int
part1 =
    parse puzzleInput
        |> List.map (distanceAfter 2503)
        |> List.maximum
        |> Maybe.withDefault -1
```

{( part2 |}

Again given the descriptions of each reindeer (in your puzzle input), after exactly 2503 seconds, **how many points does the winning reindeer have?**

{| part2 )}

To use the modified rules, we need to replace `distanceAfter` with a function to calculate the points after a given time:

```elm {l}
pointsAt : Int -> List Int -> List Int
pointsAt time distances =
    let
        points d =
            if List.maximum distances == Just d then
                1

            else
                0
    in
    List.map points distances


pointsAfter : Int -> List Reindeer -> List Int
pointsAfter maxTime reindeer =
    let
        pa time tMax points deer =
            let
                distances =
                    List.map (distanceAfter time) deer

                newPoints =
                    List.map2 (+) points (pointsAt time distances)
            in
            if time == tMax then
                newPoints

            else
                pa (time + 1) tMax newPoints deer
    in
    pa 1 maxTime (List.repeat (List.length reindeer) 0) reindeer
```

```elm {l r}
part2 : Int
part2 =
    parse puzzleInput
        |> pointsAfter 2503
        |> List.maximum
        |> Maybe.withDefault -1
```
