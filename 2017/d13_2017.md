'Part One' and 'Part Two' puzzle descriptions and puzzle input from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2017/day/13).

{( part1|}

Given the details of the firewall you've recorded, if you leave immediately, **what is the severity of your whole trip?**

{| part1 )}

```elm {l r}
part1 : Int
part1 =
    0
```

{( part2 |}

**What is the fewest number of picoseconds** that you need to delay the packet to pass through the firewall without being caught?

{| part2 )}

```elm {l r}
part2 : Int
part2 =
    0
```
