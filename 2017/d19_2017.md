# Day 19 (2017): A Series of Tubes

'Part One' and 'Part Two' puzzle descriptions and puzzle input from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2017/day/19).

{( part1|}

The little packet looks up at you, hoping you can help it find the way. **What letters will it see** (in the order it would see them) if it follows the path? (The routing diagram is very wide; make sure you view it without line wrapping.)

{| part1 )}

## Parsing

## Approach

```elm {l r}
part1 : Int
part1 =
    0
```

{( part2 |}

**How many steps** does the packet need to go?

{| part2 )}

```elm {l r}
part2 : Int
part2 =
    0
```
