# Day 23 (2017): Coprocessor Conflagration

'Part One' and 'Part Two' puzzle descriptions and puzzle input from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2017/day/23).

{( part1|}

If you run the program (your puzzle input), **how many times is the mul instruction invoked**?

{| part1 )}

```elm {l r}
part1 : Int
part1 =
    0
```

{( part2 |}

After setting register a to 1, if the program were to run to completion, **what value would be left in register h**?

{| part2 )}

```elm {l r}
part2 : Int
part2 =
    0
```
