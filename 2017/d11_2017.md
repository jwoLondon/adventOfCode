# Day 11 (2017): Hex Ed

'Part One' and 'Part Two' puzzle descriptions and puzzle input from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2017/day/11).

{( part1|}

You have the path the child process took. Starting where he started, you need to **determine the fewest number of steps required to reach him**. (A "step" means to move from the hex you are in to any adjacent hex.)

{| part1 )}

A convenient way to represent a position on a hex grid is as a position along three axes at 120 degrees to one another. While there is some redundancy here, it does make working with the positions a little simpler.

```elm {l}
type alias Position =
    ( Int, Int, Int )
```

This allows us to create some simple vector displacements and measurements:

```elm {l}
move : Position -> Position -> Position
move ( x0, y0, z0 ) ( x1, y1, z1 ) =
    ( x0 + x1, y0 + y1, z0 + z1 )


distFromOrigin : Position -> Int
distFromOrigin ( x, y, z ) =
    (abs x + abs y + abs z) // 2


toVect : String -> Position
toVect instr =
    case instr of
        "n" ->
            ( 0, 1, 1 )

        "ne" ->
            ( 1, 1, 0 )

        "se" ->
            ( 1, 0, -1 )

        "s" ->
            ( 0, -1, -1 )

        "sw" ->
            ( -1, -1, 0 )

        "nw" ->
            ( -1, 0, 1 )

        _ ->
            ( 0, 0, 0 ) |> Debug.log "Unknown instruction"
```

We then just displace the position by the vector determined by the movement instruction ("n", "ne" etc.)

```elm {l r}
part1 : Int
part1 =
    puzzleInput
        |> List.map toVect
        |> List.foldl move ( 0, 0, 0 )
        |> distFromOrigin
```

{( part2 |}

How many steps away is the furthest he ever got from his starting position?

{| part2 )}

The only modification we need for part 2 is to keep track of the intermediate locations (with `scanl`) and find the one with the maximum distance fro the origin:

```elm {l r}
part2 : Int
part2 =
    puzzleInput
        |> List.map toVect
        >> AOC.scanl move ( 0, 0, 0 )
        >> List.map distFromOrigin
        >> List.maximum
        >> Maybe.withDefault 0
```

## Reflection

This was probably one of the easiest puzzles of the month. The only "trick" was to avoid getting too distracted by the hex grid - no need for trigonometrical calculations if three axes are used.
