# Day 9 (2017): Stream Processing

'Part One' and 'Part Two' puzzle descriptions and puzzle input from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2017/day/9).

{( part1|}

What is the total score for all groups in your input?

{| part1 )}

This is a good problem to represent as a finite state machine. As we parse characters in the stream we can be in one of three states: in a group; in some garbage; or following the escape character. So let's represent those states with a custom type and a finite state machine that keeps track of the score and the depth of nested groups.

```elm {l}
type Mode
    = Escape
    | Garbage
    | Group


type alias FSM =
    { state : Mode
    , groupLevel : Int
    , groupScore : Int
    }
```

As we parse the stream depending on which state the FSM is in and the character we are parsing, we can transition to another state and accumulate the score:

```elm {l}
transition : Char -> FSM -> FSM
transition char fsm =
    case fsm.state of
        Escape ->
            { fsm | state = Garbage }

        Garbage ->
            case char of
                '!' ->
                    { fsm | state = Escape }

                '>' ->
                    { fsm | state = Group }

                _ ->
                    fsm

        Group ->
            case char of
                '<' ->
                    { fsm | state = Garbage }

                '{' ->
                    { fsm
                        | groupLevel = fsm.groupLevel + 1
                        , groupScore = fsm.groupScore + fsm.groupLevel + 1
                    }

                '}' ->
                    { fsm | groupLevel = fsm.groupLevel - 1 }

                _ ->
                    fsm
```

Now we simply send the stream to our FSM parser and report the score:

```elm {l r}
part1 : Int
part1 =
    puzzleInput
        |> String.toList
        |> List.foldl transition (FSM Group 0 0)
        |> .groupScore
```

{( part2 |}

How many non-canceled characters are within the garbage in your puzzle input?

{| part2 )}

We only need a minor modification to our FSM that keeps track of the garbage count as we parse each character and transition between states:

```elm {l}
type alias FSM2 =
    { state : Mode
    , garbageCount : Int
    , groupLevel : Int
    , groupScore : Int
    }


transition2 : Char -> FSM2 -> FSM2
transition2 char fsm =
    case fsm.state of
        Escape ->
            { fsm | state = Garbage }

        Garbage ->
            case char of
                '!' ->
                    { fsm | state = Escape }

                '>' ->
                    { fsm | state = Group }

                _ ->
                    { fsm | garbageCount = fsm.garbageCount + 1 }

        Group ->
            case char of
                '<' ->
                    { fsm | state = Garbage }

                '{' ->
                    { fsm
                        | groupLevel = fsm.groupLevel + 1
                        , groupScore = fsm.groupScore + fsm.groupLevel + 1
                    }

                '}' ->
                    { fsm | groupLevel = fsm.groupLevel - 1 }

                _ ->
                    fsm
```

Note also that this version of the FSM could also be used to solve the first part as we still keep track of the group score.

```elm {l r }
part2 : Int
part2 =
    puzzleInput
        |> String.toList
        |> List.foldl transition2 (FSM2 Group 0 0 0)
        |> .garbageCount
```
