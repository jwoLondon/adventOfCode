# Day 18 (2017): Duet

'Part One' and 'Part Two' puzzle descriptions and puzzle input from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2017/day/18).

{( part1|}

**What is the value of the recovered frequency** (the value of the most recently played sound) the **first** time a rcv instruction is executed with a non-zero value?

{| part1 )}

```elm {l r}
part1 : Int
part1 =
    0
```

{( part2 |}

Once both of your programs have terminated (regardless of what caused them to do so), **how many times did program 1 send a value**?

{| part2 )}

```elm {l r}
part2 : Int
part2 =
    0
```
