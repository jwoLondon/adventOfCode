# Day 3 (2017): Spiral Memory

'Part One' and 'Part Two' puzzle descriptions and puzzle input from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2017/day/3).

{( part1|}

**How many steps** are required to carry the data from the square identified in your puzzle input all the way to the access port?

{| part1 )}

There would appear to be two main approaches to this problem (a) 'Walk the spiral' until we get to the desired position; (b) create an algebraic solution that computes the location given an index value.

Approach (b) would seem the more efficient for large index values, so let's consider a slightly larger spiral to see if we an detect a computable pattern:

```txt
     -4  -3  -2  -1   0   1   2   3   4
   ┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
-4 ┃ 65  64  63  62  61  60  59  58  57
-3 ┃ 66  37  36  35  34  33  32  31  56
-2 ┃ 67  38  17  16  15  14  13  30  55
-1 ┃ 68  39  18   5   4   3  12  29  54
 0 ┃ 69  40  19   6   1   2  11  28  53
 1 ┃ 70  41  20   7   8   9  10  27  52
 2 ┃ 71  42  21  22  23  24  25  26  51
 3 ┃ 72  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50
 4 ┃ 73  74  75  76  77  78  79  80  81 —>
```

Note the positions of the perfect squares of the odd numbers (1, 3, 9, 25, 49, 81...) form the bottom-right corner of each spiral ring. We can use these positions as 'anchors' and find the locations relative to the anchor accordingly.

```elm {l}
spiralToLocation : Int -> ( Int, Int )
spiralToLocation n =
    let
        ring =
            ceiling ((sqrt (toFloat n) - 1) / 2)

        corner =
            (2 * ring + 1) * (2 * ring + 1)
    in
    if n >= corner - 2 * ring then
        ( n - corner + ring, ring )

    else if n >= corner - 4 * ring then
        ( -ring, n - corner + 3 * ring )

    else if n >= corner - 6 * ring then
        ( corner - 5 * ring - n, -ring )

    else
        ( ring, corner - 7 * ring - n )
```

Computing the Manhattan distance for any given location is simple:

```elm {l}
distanceFromCentre : ( Int, Int ) -> Int
distanceFromCentre ( x, y ) =
    abs x + abs y
```

```elm {l r}
part1 : Int
part1 =
    puzzleInput
        |> spiralToLocation
        |> distanceFromCentre
```

{( part2 |}

What is the **first value written** that is **larger** than your puzzle input?

{| part2 )}

We are now forced to keep track of of written memory values in order to use them to accumulate totals of neighbours. Rather than use a grid to store these values, we can use a more efficient (for Elm at least) Dictionary to do so.

```elm {l}
type alias Memory =
    Dict Int Int


highestAddress : Memory -> Int
highestAddress memory =
    Dict.keys memory |> List.maximum |> Maybe.withDefault 1


valueAtHighestAddress : Memory -> Int
valueAtHighestAddress memory =
    Dict.get (highestAddress memory) memory |> Maybe.withDefault 0
```

Because we need to find the spiral index of a neighbouring locations, we also need be able to convert from a 2d Cartesian position to its spiral index (i.e. the opposite of the conversion required in part 1):

```elm {l}
locationToSpiral : ( Int, Int ) -> Int
locationToSpiral ( x, y ) =
    let
        ring =
            max (abs x) (abs y)

        corner =
            (2 * ring + 1) * (2 * ring + 1)
    in
    if y == ring then
        corner - ring + x

    else if x == -ring then
        corner - 3 * ring + y

    else if y == -ring then
        corner - 5 * ring - x

    else
        corner - 7 * ring - y
```

The stress test can then proceed by accumulating the neighbouring memory values in spiral sequence:

```elm {l}
stressTest : Memory -> Int -> Int
stressTest memory threshold =
    if valueAtHighestAddress memory > threshold then
        valueAtHighestAddress memory

    else
        stressTest (memory |> accumNeighbours (highestAddress memory + 1)) threshold


accumNeighbours : Int -> Memory -> Memory
accumNeighbours n memory =
    let
        valueAt addr =
            Dict.get addr memory |> Maybe.withDefault 0

        ( x0, y0 ) =
            spiralToLocation n

        accum =
            (valueAt <| locationToSpiral ( x0 + 1, y0 ))
                + (valueAt <| locationToSpiral ( x0 + 1, y0 - 1 ))
                + (valueAt <| locationToSpiral ( x0, y0 - 1 ))
                + (valueAt <| locationToSpiral ( x0 - 1, y0 - 1 ))
                + (valueAt <| locationToSpiral ( x0 - 1, y0 ))
                + (valueAt <| locationToSpiral ( x0 - 1, y0 + 1 ))
                + (valueAt <| locationToSpiral ( x0, y0 + 1 ))
                + (valueAt <| locationToSpiral ( x0 + 1, y0 + 1 ))
    in
    Dict.insert n accum memory
```

```elm {l r}
part2 : Int
part2 =
    puzzleInput
        |> stressTest (Dict.singleton 1 1)
```

## Reflection

One of those puzzles where an optimisation for part 1 (algebraic determination of spiral index for any given 2d position) is not applicable to the modification in part 2. Or rather I cannot think of a way of calculating the accumulations without walking the spiral.

I note this problem uses a [Ulam-spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulam_spiral), but without registering primes.
