# Day 10 (2017): Knot Hash

'Part One' and 'Part Two' puzzle descriptions and puzzle input from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2017/day/10).

{( part1|}

What is the result of multiplying the first two numbers in the list?

{| part1 )}

See [KnotHash.elm](../src/dependencies/KnotHash.elm) for details of the knot hash process. It is moved to a separate document because [day 14](d14_2017.md) also uses knot hashing.

```elm {l r}
part1 : Int
part1 =
    let
        lengths =
            puzzleInput
                |> String.split ","
                |> List.filterMap String.toInt

        ol =
            KH.knot (KH.OffsetList 0 0 (List.range 0 255)) lengths
    in
    KH.rotateByN -ol.position ol.data
        |> List.take 2
        |> List.product
```

{( part2 |}

Treating your puzzle input as a string of ASCII characters, **what is the Knot Hash of your puzzle input?** Ignore any leading or trailing whitespace you might encounter.

{| part2 )}

## Approach

See [KnotHash.elm](../src/dependencies/KnotHash.elm) for details.

```elm {l r}
part2 : String
part2 =
    puzzleInput
        |> KH.knotHash
```

### Reflection

While it is satisfying to be able to code a process that initially looks rather complex, ultimately I found this puzzle unrewarding. Quite a lot of effort was put into coding the knot hash generation, but that effort felt like it was simply replicating detail rather than elegantly solving a problem.
