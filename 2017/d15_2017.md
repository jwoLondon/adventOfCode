# Day 15 (2017): Dueling Generators

'Part One' and 'Part Two' puzzle descriptions and puzzle input from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2017/day/15).

{( part1|}

After 40 million pairs, **what is the judge's final count**?

{| part1 )}

```elm {l r}
part1 : Int
part1 =
    0
```

{( part2 |}

After 5 million pairs, but using this new generator logic, **what is the judge's final count**?

{| part2 )}

```elm {l r}
part2 : Int
part2 =
    0
```
