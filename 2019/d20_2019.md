# Day 20 (2019): Donut Maze

'Part One' and 'Part Two' puzzle descriptions and puzzle input from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/20):

{( part1|}

You notice a strange pattern on the surface of Pluto and land nearby to get a closer look. Upon closer inspection, you realize you've come across one of the famous space-warping mazes of the long-lost Pluto civilization!

Because there isn't much space on Pluto, the civilization that used to live here thrived by inventing a method for folding spacetime. Although the technology is no longer understood, mazes like this one provide a small glimpse into the daily life of an ancient Pluto citizen.

This maze is shaped like a donut. Portals along the inner and outer edge of the donut can instantly teleport you from one side to the other. For example:

```txt
         A
         A
  #######.#########
  #######.........#
  #######.#######.#
  #######.#######.#
  #######.#######.#
  #####  B    ###.#
BC...##  C    ###.#
  ##.##       ###.#
  ##...DE  F  ###.#
  #####    G  ###.#
  #########.#####.#
DE..#######...###.#
  #.#########.###.#
FG..#########.....#
  ###########.#####
             Z
             Z
```

This map of the maze shows solid walls (#) and open passages (.). Every maze on Pluto has a start (the open tile next to AA) and an end (the open tile next to ZZ). Mazes on Pluto also have portals; this maze has three pairs of portals: BC, DE, and FG. When on an open tile next to one of these labels, a single step can take you to the other tile with the same label. (You can only walk on . tiles; labels and empty space are not traversable.)

One path through the maze doesn't require any portals. Starting at AA, you could go down 1, right 8, down 12, left 4, and down 1 to reach ZZ, a total of 26 steps.

However, there is a shorter path: You could walk from AA to the inner BC portal (4 steps), warp to the outer BC portal (1 step), walk to the inner DE (6 steps), warp to the outer DE (1 step), walk to the outer FG (4 steps), warp to the inner FG (1 step), and finally walk to ZZ (6 steps). In total, this is only **23** steps.

Here is a larger example:

```txt
                   A
                   A
  #################.#############
  #.#...#...................#.#.#

  #.#.........#...#.............#
  #########.###.###.#############
           B   J   C
           U   P   P
```

Here, AA has no direct path to ZZ, but it does connect to AS and CP. By passing through AS, QG, BU, and JO, you can reach ZZ in 58 steps.

In your maze, **how many steps does it take to get from the open tile marked AA to the open tile marked ZZ?**

## Parsing

We can read the input into a grid of characters.

```elm {l}
parse : List String -> AOC.Grid Char
parse =
    List.map String.toList
        >> AOC.gFromLists
```

and confirm the parsing works by displaying the grid:

```elm {l}
display : AOC.Grid Char -> List String
display =
    AOC.gToLists
        >> List.map String.fromList
        >> (++) [ "Maze" ]
        >> List.map
            (String.replace " " "\u{2007}"
                >> String.replace "." "▒"
                >> String.replace "#" "█"
                >> AOC.flip (++) "\n"
            )
```

{(fixed|}^^^elm {m=(display maze)}^^^{|fixed)}

## Approach

One complication is identifying the portal labels that comprise two characters that may be either horizontal or vertical. If we scan the grid from left to right and top to bottom, we can ensure the two letters of each portal label will be read in the correct order. We can build up a dictionary of portal labels and the pair of locations with which they are associated (or a single location for the entrance portal AA and exit portal ZZ).

```elm {l}
type alias PortalLookup =
    Dict String (List AOC.GridLocation)


isLetter : AOC.Grid Char -> AOC.GridLocation -> Bool
isLetter g loc =
    case AOC.gGet loc g of
        Just chr ->
            chr >= 'A' && chr <= 'Z'

        Nothing ->
            False


addPortal : AOC.Grid Char -> AOC.GridLocation -> PortalLookup -> PortalLookup
addPortal g ( row, col ) dict =
    let
        passageLocation loc =
            case AOC.gGet loc g of
                Just chr ->
                    if chr == '.' then
                        Just loc

                    else
                        Nothing

                Nothing ->
                    Nothing

        addLocation label locs =
            if Dict.member label dict then
                Dict.update label (Maybe.map ((++) locs)) dict

            else
                Dict.insert label locs dict
    in
    if isLetter g ( row, col ) && isLetter g ( row, col + 1 ) then
        let
            name =
                [ AOC.gGet ( row, col ) g, AOC.gGet ( row, col + 1 ) g ]
                    |> List.filterMap identity
                    |> String.fromList

            pLocation =
                [ passageLocation ( row, col + 2 ), passageLocation ( row, col - 1 ) ]
                    |> List.filterMap identity
        in
        addLocation name pLocation

    else if isLetter g ( row, col ) && isLetter g ( row + 1, col ) then
        let
            name =
                [ AOC.gGet ( row, col ) g, AOC.gGet ( row + 1, col ) g ]
                    |> List.filterMap identity
                    |> String.fromList

            pLocation =
                [ passageLocation ( row + 2, col ), passageLocation ( row - 1, col ) ]
                    |> List.filterMap identity
        in
        addLocation name pLocation

    else
        dict
```

We can build the dictionary of portal label to locations by folding over each cell in the maze looking for labels:

```elm {l}
portals : PortalLookup
portals =
    List.foldl (addPortal maze)
        Dict.empty
        (AOC.gridLocations ( 0, 0 ) ( AOC.gRowCount maze, AOC.gColCount maze ))
```

When we navigate the maze and come across a part of portal label we need to know its name. We can potentially approach a portal label from one of four directions:

```elm {l}
portalName : AOC.Grid Char -> AOC.GridLocation -> String
portalName g ( row, col ) =
    if isLetter g ( row, col ) && isLetter g ( row, col + 1 ) then
        [ AOC.gGet ( row, col ) g, AOC.gGet ( row, col + 1 ) g ]
            |> List.filterMap identity
            |> String.fromList

    else if isLetter g ( row, col ) && isLetter g ( row, col - 1 ) then
        [ AOC.gGet ( row, col - 1 ) g, AOC.gGet ( row, col ) g ]
            |> List.filterMap identity
            |> String.fromList

    else if isLetter g ( row, col ) && isLetter g ( row + 1, col ) then
        [ AOC.gGet ( row, col ) g, AOC.gGet ( row + 1, col ) g ]
            |> List.filterMap identity
            |> String.fromList

    else if isLetter g ( row, col ) && isLetter g ( row - 1, col ) then
        [ AOC.gGet ( row - 1, col ) g, AOC.gGet ( row, col ) g ]
            |> List.filterMap identity
            |> String.fromList

    else
        ""
```

We can then teleport to the other end of a teleport pair:

```elm {l}
teleport : String -> AOC.GridLocation -> AOC.GridLocation
teleport label loc =
    case Dict.get label portals of
        Just [ l0 ] ->
            l0

        Just [ l1, l2 ] ->
            if loc == l1 then
                l2

            else
                l1

        _ ->
            loc |> Debug.log "Unexpected portal location"
```

The main navigation through the maze is a breadth-first search of available unvisited locations, teleporting if we arrive at a teleport location.

```elm {l}
findExit : AOC.GridLocation -> List AOC.GridLocation -> Int -> Int
findExit ( row, col ) visited steps =
    let
        stepsToExit ( r0, c0 ) ( r1, c1 ) st =
            if AOC.gGet ( r1, c1 ) maze == Just '.' && not (List.member ( r1, c1 ) visited) then
                findExit ( r1, c1 ) (( r0, c0 ) :: visited) (st + 1)

            else if
                isLetter maze ( r1, c1 )
                    && not (List.member (teleport (portalName maze ( r1, c1 )) ( r0, c0 )) visited)
            then
                findExit (teleport (portalName maze ( r1, c1 )) ( r0, c0 ))
                    (( r0, c0 ) :: visited)
                    (st + 1)

            else
                999999
    in
    if ( row, col ) == exitLocation then
        steps

    else
        stepsToExit ( row, col ) ( row - 1, col ) steps
            |> min (stepsToExit ( row, col ) ( row + 1, col ) steps)
            |> min (stepsToExit ( row, col ) ( row, col - 1 ) steps)
            |> min (stepsToExit ( row, col ) ( row, col + 1 ) steps)
```

```elm {l}
maze : AOC.Grid Char
maze =
    parse test3Input


startLocation : AOC.GridLocation
startLocation =
    case Dict.get "AA" portals of
        Just locs ->
            List.head locs |> Maybe.withDefault ( -1, -1 )

        Nothing ->
            ( -1, -1 ) |> Debug.log "No entrance found"


exitLocation : AOC.GridLocation
exitLocation =
    case Dict.get "ZZ" portals of
        Just locs ->
            List.head locs |> Maybe.withDefault ( -1, -1 )

        Nothing ->
            ( -1, -1 ) |> Debug.log "No exit found"
```

```elm {l r}
part1 : Int
part1 =
    findExit startLocation [] 0
```

{( part2 |}

Strangely, the exit isn't open when you reach it. Then, you remember: the ancient Plutonians were famous for building **recursive spaces**.

The marked connections in the maze aren't portals: they **physically connect** to a larger or smaller copy of the maze. Specifically, the labeled tiles around the inside edge actually connect to a smaller copy of the same maze, and the smaller copy's inner labeled tiles connect to yet a **smaller** copy, and so on.

When you enter the maze, you are at the outermost level; when at the outermost level, only the outer labels AA and ZZ function (as the start and end, respectively); all other outer labeled tiles are effectively walls. At any other level, AA and ZZ count as walls, but the other outer labeled tiles bring you one level outward.

Your goal is to find a path through the maze that brings you back to ZZ at the outermost level of the maze.

In the first example above, the shortest path is now the loop around the right side. If the starting level is 0, then taking the previously-shortest path would pass through BC (to level 1), DE (to level 2), and FG (back to level 1). Because this is not the outermost level, ZZ is a wall, and the only option is to go back around to BC, which would only send you even deeper into the recursive maze.

In the second example above, there is no path that brings you to ZZ at the outermost level.

Here is a more interesting example:

                 Z P Q B       K

This path takes a total of **396** steps to move from AA at the outermost layer to ZZ at the outermost layer.

In your maze, when accounting for recursion, **how many steps does it take to get from the open tile marked AA to the open tile marked ZZ, both at the outermost layer?**
