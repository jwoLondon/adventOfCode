# Day 11 (2019): Space Police

'Part One' and 'Part Two' puzzle descriptions and puzzle input from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/11)

## Part 1

The direction the robot faces can be represented as a pair of integers describing a unit vector with dx and dy components:

```elm {l}
type alias Direction =
    ( Int, Int )
```

To keep code clear, we use types rather than integers for the robot instructions/state.

```elm {l}
type Turn
    = TurnLeft
    | TurnRight
    | NoTurn


type Colour
    = Black
    | White
    | NoColour


toTurn : Int -> Turn
toTurn n =
    case n of
        0 ->
            TurnLeft

        1 ->
            TurnRight

        _ ->
            NoTurn


toColour : Int -> Colour
toColour n =
    case n of
        0 ->
            Black

        1 ->
            White

        _ ->
            NoColour


fromColour : Colour -> Int
fromColour colour =
    case colour of
        Black ->
            0

        White ->
            1

        NoColour ->
            999
```

We can represent the robot and the panels it has visited as a record:

```elm {l}
type alias Robot =
    { computer : Computer
    , position : ( Int, Int )
    , movement : ( Int, Int )
    , panels : Dict ( Int, Int ) Colour
    }
```

This allows us to update the robot's state as it reads the panel colour and moves about the spacecraft. A left turn results in the the direction vector transformation (dx, dy) -> (dy, -dx) and a right turn (dx, dy) -> (-dy, dx):

```elm {l}
move : Int -> ( AOC.GridLocation, Direction ) -> ( AOC.GridLocation, Direction )
move tNum ( ( x, y ), ( dx, dy ) ) =
    let
        ( newDx, newDy ) =
            case toTurn tNum of
                TurnLeft ->
                    ( dy, -dx )

                TurnRight ->
                    ( -dy, dx )

                NoTurn ->
                    ( 0, 0 ) |> Debug.log "Bad turn instruction"

        newPosition =
            ( x + newDx, y + newDy )
    in
    ( newPosition, ( newDx, newDy ) )
```

At each increment in time, the robot (a) reads the colour at its location (read from dictionary); (b) runs the computer program to determine the new panel colour and direction to turn (runs its intcode program); (c) paints the panel in that new colour (inserts entry in dictionary); (d) turns and moves (updates position and direction vector).

```elm {l}
tick : Robot -> Robot
tick robot =
    let
        ( x, y ) =
            robot.position

        ( dx, dy ) =
            robot.movement

        panelColour =
            Dict.get ( x, y ) robot.panels |> Maybe.withDefault Black

        newComputer =
            robot.computer
                |> clearOutput
                |> addInput (fromColour panelColour)
                |> runProg
    in
    case newComputer.status of
        Halted ->
            { robot | computer = newComputer }

        _ ->
            let
                ( newColour, turn ) =
                    case newComputer.outputStore of
                        [ o1, o2 ] ->
                            ( toColour o1, toTurn o2 )

                        _ ->
                            ( NoColour, NoTurn ) |> Debug.log "Expecting a pair of output values"

                ( newDx, newDy ) =
                    case turn of
                        TurnLeft ->
                            ( dy, -dx )

                        TurnRight ->
                            ( -dy, dx )

                        NoTurn ->
                            ( 0, 0 ) |> Debug.log "Bad turn instruction"
            in
            { robot
                | computer = newComputer
                , position = ( x + newDx, y + newDy )
                , movement = ( newDx, newDy )
                , panels = Dict.insert ( x, y ) newColour robot.panels
            }
```

We can then just set off the robot until the program halts:

```elm {l}
runRobot robot =
    case robot.computer.status of
        Halted ->
            robot

        _ ->
            runRobot (tick robot)
```

The number of painted cells will be the size of the robot's panel dictionary (storing the location and colour of all painted panels).

```elm {l r}
part1 : Int
part1 =
    Robot (initComputer [] puzzleInput) ( 0, 0 ) ( 0, -1 ) Dict.empty
        |> runRobot
        |> .panels
        |> Dict.size
```

---

## Part 2

As the robot accumulates a dictionary of all the panel locations it has painted, to see the registration identifier, we simply convert it into a grid:

```elm {l}
toGrid : List ( Int, Int ) -> AOC.Grid Char
toGrid locations =
    let
        ( xs, ys ) =
            List.unzip locations

        minX =
            List.minimum xs |> Maybe.withDefault -99

        maxX =
            List.maximum xs |> Maybe.withDefault 99

        minY =
            List.minimum ys |> Maybe.withDefault -99

        maxY =
            List.maximum ys |> Maybe.withDefault 99

        empty =
            AOC.gInit (1 + maxY - minY) (1 + maxX - minX) '.'

        grid =
            List.foldl (\( x, y ) g -> AOC.gSet ( y - minY, x - minX ) '█' g) empty locations

        lines =
            grid
                |> AOC.gToList
                |> AOC.groupsOf (AOC.gColCount grid)
                |> List.map ((::) '\n')
                |> List.concat
    in
    grid
```

To view the message we can show just the white panels.

```elm {l}
part2 : List String
part2 =
    Robot (initComputer [] puzzleInput) ( 0, 0 ) ( 0, -1 ) (Dict.singleton ( 0, 0 ) White)
        |> runRobot
        |> .panels
        |> Dict.filter (\loc colour -> colour == White)
        |> Dict.keys
        |> toGrid
        |> AOC.gToLists
        |> List.map ((::) '\n' >> String.fromList)
```

## Reflection

On the face of it, this should have been a fairly simple puzzle to solve. I felt I knew what needed to be done after the first reading of the question; building up a dictionary of painted panels should have yielded the correct answer. But frustratingly I was getting an incorrect count for part 1 (about a third of the correct answer).

I ended up creating a grid view of the painted panels in order to get a better view of what might be going wrong. But this still yielded a credible, but incorrect grid of painted panels. I spent many hours going over the code but still no luck. Eventually I revisited my [intcode](intcode.md) program to see if I had made some error in its implementation. It passed all the tests given in [day 9](d09_2019.md), and I couldn't see any obvious errors. Finally, I spotted that the program wasn't updating the instruction pointer when pausing for input, but only after some instructions, so difficult to spot. None of the day 8 tests were testing for paused input, so hadn't detected this problem. Once corrected, this yielded the correct answer. And part 2 was a trivial addition as I had already created the grid view of the painted panels.
