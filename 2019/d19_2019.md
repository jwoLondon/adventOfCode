# Day 19 (2019): Tractor Beam

'Part One' and 'Part Two' puzzle descriptions and puzzle input from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/19)

## Part 1

Firstly, we initialise the Intcode computer with the puzzle input:

```elm {l}
droneComputer : Computer
droneComputer =
    puzzleInput |> initComputer []
```

We can then query any point in space to see if it is affected by the tractor beam:

```elm {l}
readBeam : AOC.GridLocation -> Int
readBeam ( row, col ) =
    droneComputer
        |> addInput col
        |> addInput row
        |> runProg
        |> .out
```

To view the shape of the beam we can assemble the beam readings into a grid:

```elm {l}
grid : Int -> Int -> AOC.Grid Int
grid width height =
    AOC.gInit height width 0
        |> AOC.gMapWithLocation (AOC.flip (always readBeam))
```

and then display the grid:

```elm {l}
display : AOC.Grid Int -> List String
display =
    let
        toSymbols =
            List.map
                (\n ->
                    case n of
                        1 ->
                            '▓'

                        _ ->
                            '░'
                )
                >> List.intersperse '\u{2006}'
                >> String.fromList
                >> AOC.flip (++) "\n"
    in
    AOC.gToLists
        >> List.map toSymbols
```

Counting the number of cells within the tractor beam simply involves summing the values of the grid.

```elm {l r}
part1 : Int
part1 =
    --grid 50 50 |> gToList |> List.sum
    206
```

## Part 2

Examining the width of the tractor beam we see it progresses in a largely predictable sequence (minor variations caused by integer rounding of the beam trajectory):

{(fixed|}^^^elm { m=(display (grid 33 20))}^^^{|fixed)}

A good enough solution can be found by detecting the first column in any given row that is within the beam and checking whether `(row - 99, col + 99)` (top-right of square) is also in the beam.

Looking at the the positions of the first 6 squares, the nearest row in which they can fit is approximately 6 x the square size.

We can use 600 + squareSize as an initial estimate for where the first 100x100 square will fit and then increase row incrementally until we can fit envelope a square:

```elm {l r}
part2 : Int
part2 =
    let
        sqSize =
            100

        beamEdge row col =
            if row < 2 then
                0

            else
                case readBeam ( row, col ) of
                    1 ->
                        col

                    _ ->
                        beamEdge row (col + 1)

        fitSquare ( row, col ) =
            readBeam ( row - (sqSize - 1), col + sqSize - 1 ) == 1

        ( cRow, cCol ) =
            List.map (\n -> ( n, beamEdge n n )) (List.range 700 720)
                |> List.filter fitSquare
                |> List.head
                |> Maybe.withDefault ( 0, 0 )
                |> Tuple.mapFirst (\r -> r - (sqSize - 1))
    in
    cRow * 10000 + cCol
```

## Reflection

Ultimately a straightforward puzzle that's easily solved by iterating the intcode program within some identifiable bounds. I was tripped up by identifying the correct location of the square in part 2 but transposing rows and columns which led to the wrong number submitted as a puzzle answer.

Initially I tried to model the progression given the apparently predictable beam pattern. Observing the beam width in the near rows

row: -1, 0,1, 2,3,4, 5,6,7, 8,9,10, 11,12,13, 14,15,16
width: (0),1,0, 1,2,1, 2,3,2, 3,4, 3, 4, 5, 4, 5, 6, 5 etc.

can be modelled from row 2 onwards with

```elm
beamWidth row =
    (row - 1) // 3 + modBy 3 (row - 1)
```

Similarly for the column position of the left of the tractor beam:

row: -1, 0,1, 2,3,4, 5,6,7, 8, 9,10, 11,12,13, 14,15,16
col: (-1),0, , 3,4,6, 7,8,10, 11,12,14, 15,16,18, 19,20,22

which can be represented with

```elm
beamLeftCol row =
    (4 * (row + 1) - 2) // 3
```

The largest square that can be contained at given row (top-left of square)

row: -1, 0,1, 2,3,4, 5,6,7, 8,9,10, 11,12,13, 14,15,16, 17,18,19, 20,21,22
sqWidth: 0, 1,0, 1,1,1, 1,1,1, 2,2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4

with some help from OEIS suggested [this pattern](https://oeis.org/A067100) with a credible explanation.

```elm
maxSquare row =
    let
        cot x =
            cos x / sin x
    in
    floor (cot (pi / toFloat (row + 5)) / 2)
```

However, I failed to spot that the pattern breaks down at row 24 and periodically after that. It gives an approximation that could be used to bound a search, but it wouldn't necessarily provide a more general solution for other inputs.
