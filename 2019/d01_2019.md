# Day 1 (2019): The Tyranny of the Rocket Equation

'Part One' and 'Part Two' puzzle descriptions and puzzle input from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/1)

## Part 1

This requires just a simple rounded division and subtraction function applied to each number in the input list of modules.

```elm {l}
fuel : Int -> Int
fuel mass =
    (mass // 3) - 2
```

```elm {l r}
part1 : Int
part1 =
    puzzleInput
        |> List.map fuel
        |> List.sum
```

---

## Part 2

We just need to apply the fuel calculation recursively, keeping track of the total until there is no more positive fuel left. The new totals are then summed to provide the final answer.

```elm {l}
fuel2 : Int -> Int -> Int
fuel2 total mass =
    let
        f =
            fuel mass
    in
    if f <= 0 then
        total

    else
        fuel2 (total + f) f
```

```elm {l r}
part2 : Int
part2 =
    puzzleInput
        |> List.map (fuel2 0)
        |> List.sum
```

## Reflection

A nice easy warm-up for the month with clear instructions in the puzzle itself on how to solve. Could represent the answers more compactly by folding over the list of modules

```elm
List.foldl (\m -> (+) (m // 3 - 2)) 0 puzzleInput
```

but summing as a separate operation is clearer, especially for part 2, where an inline recursive fuel mass calculation would hinder clarity.
