# Day 13 (2019): Care Package

'Part One' and 'Part Two' puzzle descriptions and puzzle input from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/13)

## Part 1

Parsing the intcode is already handled by the [intcode computer](intcode.md). We now have to consider how to parse the output of a completed intcode program. In this case all outputs are sequences of data in _x,y, tileCode_ order. Let's first provide a representation of each tile type (`Score` is ignored here but used for part 2).

```elm {l}
type Tile
    = Empty
    | Wall
    | Block
    | Paddle
    | Ball
    | Score Int


toTile : Int -> Tile
toTile n =
    case n of
        1 ->
            Wall

        2 ->
            Block

        3 ->
            Paddle

        4 ->
            Ball

        _ ->
            Empty
```

Parsing the intcode output involves extracting numbers in groups of three and store them in a dictionary that relates location to tile type:

```elm {l}
type alias Tiles =
    Dict ( Int, Int ) Tile


outputTiles : Computer -> Tiles
outputTiles comp =
    comp.outputStore
        |> AOC.groupsOf 3
        |> List.filterMap AOC.tripletFromList
        |> List.foldl
            (\( x, y, tc ) tiles ->
                Dict.insert ( x, y )
                    (if x == -1 && y == 0 then
                        Score tc

                     else
                        toTile tc
                    )
                    tiles
            )
            Dict.empty
```

Most of the work is done by parsing the intcode output into a dictionary of tiles. We just need to count the number of `Block` tiles:

```elm {l}
numBlocks : Tiles -> Int
numBlocks =
    Dict.values
        >> List.filter ((==) Block)
        >> List.length
```

```elm {l r}
part1 : Int
part1 =
    puzzleInput
        |> initComputer []
        |> runProg
        |> outputTiles
        |> numBlocks
```

## Part 2

## Visualizing the Game

To understand how the game works, it is useful to be able to visualize it as the game progresses. To do this, we can convert the dictionary of tiles into a grid and symbolise each grid cell. To create the grid we need to know how many rows and columns of tiles we need to represent.

```elm {l}
type alias Bounds =
    { minX : Int, minY : Int, maxX : Int, maxY : Int }


dimensions : List ( Int, Int ) -> Bounds
dimensions locations =
    let
        ( xs, ys ) =
            List.unzip locations
    in
    { minX = List.minimum xs |> Maybe.withDefault 0
    , minY = List.minimum ys |> Maybe.withDefault 0
    , maxX = List.maximum xs |> Maybe.withDefault 0
    , maxY = List.maximum ys |> Maybe.withDefault 0
    }
```

And then convert each cell in the grid into an appropriate symbol:

```elm {l}
display : Tiles -> List String
display tiles =
    let
        bounds =
            tiles |> Dict.keys |> dimensions

        symbol tile =
            case tile of
                Wall ->
                    '█'

                Block ->
                    '▓'

                Paddle ->
                    '═'

                Ball ->
                    '■'

                _ ->
                    '░'

        empty =
            AOC.gInit (1 + bounds.maxY - bounds.minY)
                (1 + bounds.maxX - bounds.minY)
                (symbol Empty)
    in
    Dict.foldl (\( x, y ) tile g -> AOC.gSet ( y, x ) (symbol tile) g) empty tiles
        |> AOC.gToLists
        |> List.map ((::) '\n')
        |> List.map String.fromList
```

{(fixed|}

```elm {m}
displayInitScreen : List String
displayInitScreen =
    puzzleInput
        |> initComputer []
        |> poke 0 2
        |> runProg
        |> outputTiles
        |> display
```

{|fixed)}

Iterating a few times we see the game follows classic 'breakout' rules: The ball destroying blocks on contact, accumulating score, and the game continuing while the moving paddle prevents it from reaching the bottom of the grid.

## Playing the Game

To keep the game in play we can move the paddle to match the x-position of the ball and replace any tiles that have changed state resulting from the new output:

```elm {l}
followBall : ( Computer, Tiles ) -> ( Computer, Tiles )
followBall ( comp, tiles ) =
    let
        ballX =
            Dict.filter (\_ -> (==) Ball)
                >> Dict.keys
                >> List.head
                >> Maybe.withDefault ( 0, 0 )
                >> Tuple.first

        paddleX =
            Dict.filter (\_ -> (==) Paddle)
                >> Dict.keys
                >> List.head
                >> Maybe.withDefault ( 0, 0 )
                >> Tuple.first

        comp2 =
            comp
                |> clearOutput
                |> addInput (ballX tiles - paddleX tiles)
                |> runProg

        newTiles =
            comp2 |> outputTiles
    in
    ( comp2, Dict.union newTiles tiles )
```

To find the score after all bricks have been removed, we continue the game until the number of bricks left is zero:

```elm {l r}
part2 : Tile
part2 =
    let
        playUntilNoBlocks ( comp, tiles ) =
            case numBlocks tiles of
                0 ->
                    tiles

                _ ->
                    playUntilNoBlocks (followBall ( comp, tiles ))

        initComp =
            puzzleInput
                |> initComputer []
                |> poke 0 2
                |> runProg

        initTiles =
            initComp |> outputTiles
    in
    playUntilNoBlocks ( initComp, outputTiles initComp )
        |> Dict.get ( -1, 0 )
        |> Maybe.withDefault (Score 0)
```

## Reflection

I had little time for my initial attempt at this puzzle. Just enough to complete the first part. Later, in trying to complete part two, I initially tried hacking the intcode to insert a wall below the paddle. This resulted in a stack overflow which I mistakenly attributed to a buggy intcode interpreter. Further investigation revealed it was due to accumulating an ever larger set of outputs from the intcode on each new iteration of the game. This was avoided by clearing output on each iteration. It took a little while to realise that output from the intcode on each subsequent iteration was only those tiles that had changed since the previous iteration, so a union of the tile dictionaries on each iteration maintained a full description of the game as it progressed.

In the end I was pleased to be able to derive the answer without any reliance on hacking the intcode or peeking at its contents (e.g. to find the paddle and ball location).
