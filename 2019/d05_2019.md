# Day 5 (2019): Day 5: Sunny with a Chance of Asteroids

'Part One' and 'Part Two' puzzle descriptions and puzzle input from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/5)

## Part 1

For details of how the IntCode Computer has been adapted to handle the new instructions, immediate and position modes, see [intcode.md](#intcode.md).

We can use the output log generated by the computer and filter for output commands to find the final answer (the one immediately before a HALT)

```elm {l r}
part1 : Int
part1 =
    puzzleInput
        |> initComputer [ 1 ]
        |> runProg
        |> .out
```

---

## Part 2

With the intcode interpreter containing the jump and comparison functions, we simply rerun the program with an initial input of 5.

```elm {l r}
part2 : Int
part2 =
    puzzleInput
        |> initComputer [ 5 ]
        |> runProg
        |> .out
```

## Reflection

Enjoyable puzzle and good to see intcode developing so early in the month. I spent considerable time refactoring the day 2 intcode functions to accommodate the extra state required for storing input, output and a debug-friendly dissembled log of processed commands. I was also flummoxed by a bug that mixed immediate and position modes for the output from a couple functions, which took a while to spot.
