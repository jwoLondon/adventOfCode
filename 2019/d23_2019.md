# Day 23 (2019): Category Six

'Part One' and 'Part Two' puzzle descriptions and puzzle input from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/23)

## Part 1

Create a dictionary of 50 NIC computers, each referenced by its network address (0-49), a queue of packets that have yet to be processed and the result of the last packet sent to address 255 (which we learn in part 2 is called a NAT).

```elm {l}
type alias Network =
    { nics : Dict Int Computer
    , packetQ : Deque (List Int)
    , nat : Maybe ( Int, Int )
    }


initNetwork : Network
initNetwork =
    { nics =
        List.foldl
            (\addr ->
                Dict.insert addr (puzzleInput |> initComputer [ addr ] |> runProg)
            )
            Dict.empty
            (List.range 0 49)
    , packetQ = Deque.empty
    , nat = Nothing
    }
```

When any computer generates output, we extract it and add it to the packet queue:

```elm {l}
extractPackets : Network -> Deque (List Int)
extractPackets net =
    let
        addToQueue nic queue =
            List.foldl Deque.pushBack queue (AOC.groupsOf 3 nic.outputStore)
    in
    List.foldl addToQueue net.packetQ (Dict.values net.nics)
```

We can extract the oldest packet and send it to the relevant computer:

```elm {l}
sendPacket : Network -> Network
sendPacket net =
    case Deque.popFront net.packetQ of
        ( Just [ addr, x, y ], q ) ->
            case Dict.get addr net.nics of
                Just nic ->
                    { net | nics = Dict.insert addr (addInputs [ y, x ] nic) net.nics, packetQ = q }

                Nothing ->
                    { net | nat = Just ( x, y ), packetQ = q }

        _ ->
            net |> Debug.log "Empty packet store"
```

Every cycle we transfer outputs to inputs via the packet queue.

```elm {l}
tick : Network -> Network
tick net =
    let
        newNICs =
            Dict.map (\_ -> addInput -1 >> runProg) net.nics

        q =
            extractPackets { net | nics = newNICs }
    in
    sendPacket { net | nics = Dict.map (\_ -> clearOutput) newNICs, packetQ = q }
```

We can now just run the computer network for some cycles until we receive a packet for the NAT at address 255:

```elm {l r}
part1 : Int
part1 =
    let
        runUntil255 net =
            case net.nat of
                Just ( x, y ) ->
                    y

                Nothing ->
                    runUntil255 (tick net)
    in
    runUntil255 initNetwork
```

---

## Part 2

We need to be able to detect when all computers in the network are idle, which is when there is noting in the packet queue and no inputs pending in any of the computers. This allows us to run the network until it becomes idle:

```elm {l}
runUntilIdle : Network -> Network
runUntilIdle net =
    if (Dict.values net.nics |> List.concatMap .inputStore) == [] && Deque.isEmpty net.packetQ then
        net

    else
        runUntilIdle (tick net)
```

At which point, we will need to pass the NAT packet to NIC 0:

```elm {l}
natToNic0 : Network -> Network
natToNic0 net =
    let
        natPacket network =
            case network.nat of
                Just ( x, y ) ->
                    [ y, x ]

                Nothing ->
                    []
    in
    case Dict.get 0 net.nics of
        Just nic0 ->
            { net | nics = Dict.insert 0 (addInputs (natPacket net) nic0) net.nics }

        Nothing ->
            net
```

Now we keep running the network to the next idle point, halting when the NAT packet's y-value is the same as the previous one.

```elm {l}
tick2 : Network -> Network
tick2 =
    runUntilIdle >> natToNic0
```

```elm {l r}
part2 : Int
part2 =
    let
        runUntilRepeat ( net, lastNat ) =
            case net.nat of
                Just ( _, y ) ->
                    if y == lastNat then
                        y

                    else
                        runUntilRepeat ( tick2 net, y )

                Nothing ->
                    -1 |> Debug.log "Unexpected halt with nothing in the NAT"
    in
    runUntilRepeat ( tick2 (tick initNetwork), -1 )
```

## Reflection

My initial approach to this for part 1 was to create a dictionary of packets, using the computer id as the key. This worked for part 1, but not for part 2 as doing so lost the original order of packet generation. It was necessary to preserve that order because address 255 (the NAT) would receive many packets, but only the last one was to be used.

The final approach adopted was to create a single queue of packets, which therefore preserved packet generation order.
