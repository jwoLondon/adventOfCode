# Day 24 (2019): Planet of Discord

'Part One' and 'Part Two' puzzle descriptions and puzzle input from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/24):

## Part 1

We can represent the live cells as a set, avoiding the need to store a full grid.

```elm {l}
type alias Cell =
    ( Int, Int )


type alias Grid =
    Set Cell
```

Parsing is simple as we just need to identify the `#` characters in the ordered set of input strings.

```elm {l}
parse : List String -> Grid
parse lines =
    let
        rows =
            List.indexedMap (\row cs -> ( row, cs )) lines

        cols ( row, cs ) =
            List.indexedMap (\col c -> ( ( col, row ), c )) (String.toList cs)
    in
    List.concatMap cols rows
        |> List.filter (\( _, c ) -> c == '#')
        |> List.map Tuple.first
        |> Set.fromList
```

and we can confirm the status of any grid by displaying it:

```elm {l}
showCell : Grid -> Cell -> Char
showCell liveCells p =
    if Set.member p liveCells then
        '🐞'

    else
        '🌱'
```

```elm {l}
display : (Cell -> Char) -> String
display toChr =
    let
        addRow y =
            (++) (List.map (\x -> toChr ( x, y )) (List.range 0 4) ++ [ '\n' ])
    in
    List.foldr addRow [] (List.range 0 4) |> String.fromList
```

{(fixed|}^^^elm {m=(display (showCell (parse test1Input)))}^^^{|fixed)}

This would appear to be a standard cellular automata / Game of Life implementation with a cliff-edge beyond (0,0) and (4,4) and the additional need to detect cycles (e.g. like [day 18, 2015](../2015/d18_2015.md)).

The only cells that can change their bug/space status from one generation to the next will be those at current bug locations or their immediate neighbours. Anything outside of those location would be too far away from any bug to change so do not need to be considered.

We therefore need to identify any cell's immediate neighbours:

```elm {l}
neighbours : Cell -> Grid
neighbours ( x0, y0 ) =
    [ ( x0 - 1, y0 ), ( x0 + 1, y0 ), ( x0, y0 - 1 ), ( x0, y0 + 1 ) ]
        |> List.filter (\( x, y ) -> x >= 0 && y >= 0 && x < 5 && y < 5)
        |> Set.fromList
```

in order to count the number of neighbouring bugs:

```elm {l}
numNeighbouringBugs : Grid -> Cell -> Int
numNeighbouringBugs bugs cell =
    Set.intersect bugs (neighbours cell) |> Set.size
```

The basic life death rules can be encoded:

```elm {l}
rule : Bool -> Int -> Bool
rule isAlive n =
    n == 1 || (not <| isAlive) && n == 2
```

which allows us to decide whether a cell will be alive in the next generation:

```elm {l}
live : Grid -> Cell -> Bool
live bugs cell =
    rule (Set.member cell bugs) (numNeighbouringBugs bugs cell)
```

which we can apply to all bug cells and their immediate neighbours:

```elm {l}
generation : Grid -> Grid
generation bugs =
    bugs
        |> Set.toList
        |> List.concatMap (Set.toList << neighbours)
        |> Set.fromList
        |> Set.filter (live bugs)
```

We can use `sequenceCycle` from [Aoc.elm](../src/Aoc.md) to detect a repeated sequence.

```elm {l}
firstRepeat : Grid -> Grid
firstRepeat initCells =
    case AOC.sequenceCycle 0 initCells generation of
        Just ( _, cyclePos ) ->
            AOC.iterate cyclePos initCells generation

        Nothing ->
            initCells |> Debug.log "No repeats found"
```

Finally, once we have a set of bugs after some generations we need to be able to calculate its biodiversity rating:

```elm {l}
biodiversity : Grid -> Int
biodiversity =
    Set.map (\( x, y ) -> 2 ^ (y * 5 + x)) >> Set.foldl (+) 0
```

```elm {l r}
part1 : Int
part1 =
    puzzleInput
        |> parse
        |> firstRepeat
        |> biodiversity
```

## Part 2

To account for the recursive nature of the tiles we can add an extra dimension to each cell recording its depth.

```elm {l}
type alias Cell2 =
    ( Int, Int, Int )


type alias Grid2 =
    Set Cell2
```

The depth and number of adjacent cells will change for central or outer neighbours:

```elm {l}
neighbours2 : Cell2 -> Grid2
neighbours2 ( x0, y0, d ) =
    let
        adjacentCells ( fromX, fromY ) ( toX, toY ) =
            -- Outer neighbours
            if toX < 0 then
                [ ( 1, 2, d - 1 ) ]

            else if toX > 4 then
                [ ( 3, 2, d - 1 ) ]

            else if toY < 0 then
                [ ( 2, 1, d - 1 ) ]

            else if toY > 4 then
                [ ( 2, 3, d - 1 ) ]

            else if toX == 2 && toY == 2 then
                -- Inner neighbours
                if fromX == 1 then
                    List.map (\y -> ( 0, y, d + 1 )) (List.range 0 4)

                else if fromX == 3 then
                    List.map (\y -> ( 4, y, d + 1 )) (List.range 0 4)

                else if fromY == 1 then
                    List.map (\x -> ( x, 0, d + 1 )) (List.range 0 4)

                else
                    List.map (\x -> ( x, 4, d + 1 )) (List.range 0 4)

            else
                -- Internal neighbours
                [ ( toX, toY, d ) ]
    in
    [ ( x0 - 1, y0 ), ( x0 + 1, y0 ), ( x0, y0 - 1 ), ( x0, y0 + 1 ) ]
        |> List.concatMap (adjacentCells ( x0, y0 ))
        |> Set.fromList
```

To calculate the next generation we can proceed as with part one but with the new adjacency rules:

```elm {l}
numNeighbouringBugs2 : Grid2 -> Cell2 -> Int
numNeighbouringBugs2 bugs cell =
    Set.intersect bugs (neighbours2 cell) |> Set.size
```

```elm {l}
live2 : Grid2 -> Cell2 -> Bool
live2 bugs cell =
    rule (Set.member cell bugs) (numNeighbouringBugs2 bugs cell)
```

```elm {l}
generation2 : Grid2 -> Grid2
generation2 bugs =
    bugs
        |> Set.toList
        |> List.concatMap (Set.toList << neighbours2)
        |> Set.fromList
        |> Set.filter (live2 bugs)
```

```elm {l r}
part2 : Int
part2 =
    let
        init =
            puzzleInput
                |> parse
                |> Set.map (\( x, y ) -> ( x, y, 0 ))
    in
    AOC.iterate 200 init generation2
        |> Set.size
```

## Reflection

Part one was a simple implementation of cellular automata with rooks-case adjacency so was easy to implement. The clamping of the neighbourhood to a 5x5 grid allowed cycles to be more easily generated leading to a quick computation of the cycle period.

My initial attempt at part two created a tree data structure for nested grids, but this not necessary as the tree was a single branch in each direction away from the initial grid. It was therefore much simplified by storing the grid depth as a third element in each cell's tuple representation.
