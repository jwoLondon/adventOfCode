# Day 10 (2019): Monitoring Station

'Part One' and 'Part Two' puzzle descriptions and puzzle input from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/10):

## Part 1

For easy manipulation by position, convert the input list into a grid:

```elm {l}
parse : List String -> AOC.Grid Char
parse =
    List.map String.toList
        >> AOC.gFromLists
```

From which we can identify asteroid locations easily:

```elm {l}
asteroidLocations : AOC.Grid Char -> List AOC.GridLocation
asteroidLocations =
    AOC.gMapWithLocation
        (\loc z ->
            if z == '#' then
                Just loc

            else
                Nothing
        )
        >> AOC.gToList
        >> List.filterMap identity
```

We can consider asteroids from nearest to furthest in case any near ones block the view to more distant ones. Given an origin asteroid, we can find the locations of all the others, sorted by their distance from it.

```elm {l}
otherAsteroids : AOC.GridLocation -> AOC.Grid Char -> List AOC.GridLocation
otherAsteroids ( r0, c0 ) =
    asteroidLocations
        >> List.filter ((/=) ( r0, c0 ))
        >> List.sortBy (\( r, c ) -> abs (r - r0) + abs (c - c0))
```

For any given cell and a blocking one, we can find all cells that would be blocked by it, which will allow us to identify those asteroids obscured by a nearer one. We do this by finding the vector from a a given location to a blocking location and then convert it to its smallest integer vector components. For example a vector of (4,4) would be reduced to (1,1) and a vector of (6,4) would be reduced to (3,2).

```elm {l}
blocked : Int -> Int -> AOC.GridLocation -> AOC.GridLocation -> List AOC.GridLocation
blocked nRows nCols ( row0, col0 ) ( rowB, colB ) =
    if row0 == rowB && col0 == colB then
        []

    else
        let
            maxDist =
                max nRows nCols

            hcf =
                AOC.highestCommonFactor (rowB - row0) (colB - col0)

            dRow =
                (rowB - row0) // hcf

            dCol =
                (colB - col0) // hcf
        in
        List.map (\d -> ( rowB + d * dRow, colB + d * dCol )) (List.range 1 maxDist)
            |> List.filter (\( r, c ) -> r >= 0 && r < nRows && c >= 0 && c < nCols)
```

Then we can find the asteroids in direct line of sight by removing all the asteroids that are blocked by a nearer one:

```elm {l}
directView : AOC.GridLocation -> AOC.Grid Char -> AOC.Grid Char
directView origin grid =
    let
        nRows =
            AOC.gRowCount grid

        nCols =
            AOC.gColCount grid

        blockedLocations r c =
            blocked nRows nCols origin ( r, c )

        removeBlocked sortedLocations visible =
            case sortedLocations of
                [] ->
                    visible

                loc :: tl ->
                    let
                        invisible =
                            blocked nRows nCols origin loc
                    in
                    removeBlocked (List.filter (\l -> not (List.member l invisible)) tl)
                        (loc :: visible)
    in
    List.foldl (\loc -> AOC.gSet loc '#')
        (AOC.gInit nRows nCols '.')
        (removeBlocked (otherAsteroids origin grid) [])
```

We can find the number of asteroids visible from the optimal location and (useful for part 2) the optimal location itself.

```elm {l r}
part1 : ( Int, AOC.GridLocation )
part1 =
    let
        grid =
            puzzleInput |> parse

        numVisible g loc =
            directView loc g
                |> AOC.gToList
                |> List.filter ((==) '#')
                |> List.length
    in
    grid
        |> asteroidLocations
        |> List.map (\loc -> ( numVisible grid loc, loc ))
        |> List.sortBy Tuple.first
        |> List.reverse
        |> List.head
        |> Maybe.withDefault ( 0, ( 0, 0 ) )
```

## Part 2

We need to be able to sweep the cannon a full 360 degrees moving clockwise from north. To do this we can find the vectors for each grid cell relative to cannon and order them by clockwise from north angle. This single sweep avoids having to divide the sweeps into quadrants as implied by the question.

```elm {l}
orderedLocations : AOC.GridLocation -> AOC.Grid Char -> List AOC.GridLocation
orderedLocations ( r0, c0 ) grid =
    otherAsteroids ( r0, c0 ) grid
        |> List.map (\( r, c ) -> ( r - r0, c - c0 ))
        |> List.sortBy (\( r, c ) -> -1 * atan2 (toFloat c) (toFloat r))
        |> List.map (\( r, c ) -> ( r + r0, c + c0 ))
```

To find the 200th asteroid blasted by the cannon, we identify all asteroids within direct view, order them by angle (which would be the order in which they are blasted), and find the 200th asteroid in that ordered list.

```elm {l r}
part2 : Int
part2 =
    let
        cannonLocation =
            part1 |> Tuple.second

        grid =
            parse puzzleInput

        asteroid200 =
            grid
                |> directView cannonLocation
                |> orderedLocations cannonLocation
                |> List.drop 199
                |> List.head
                |> Maybe.withDefault ( 0, 0 )
    in
    (100 * Tuple.second asteroid200) + Tuple.first asteroid200
```

## Reflection

This is the only puzzle this year, and in previous years, where I have used floating point arithmetic to find a solution (for part 2). Calculating the angle of each asteroid relative to the cannon location avoided having to separate the asteroids into quadrants, within which integer arithmetic could be used. This feels a little like 'cheating' as all the puzzles are designed to be solvable with integer arithmetic. But I'd argue the coding clarity from using a single sweep outweighs the preference to stick to integer representation.
