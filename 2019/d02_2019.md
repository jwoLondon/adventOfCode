# Day 2 (2019): 1202 Program Alarm

'Part One' and 'Part Two' puzzle descriptions and puzzle input from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/2):

{( part1|}

On the way to your gravity assist around the Moon, your ship computer beeps angrily about a "1202 program alarm". On the radio, an Elf is already explaining how to handle the situation: "Don't worry, that's perfectly norma--" The ship computer bursts into flames.

You notify the Elves that the computer's magic smoke seems to have escaped. "That computer ran **Intcode** programs like the gravity assist program it was working on; surely there are enough spare parts up there to build a new Intcode computer!"

An Intcode program is a list of integers separated by commas (like 1,0,0,3,99). To run one, start by looking at the first integer (called position 0). Here, you will find an **opcode** - either 1, 2, or 99. The opcode indicates what to do; for example, 99 means that the program is finished and should immediately halt. Encountering an unknown opcode means something went wrong.

Opcode 1 **adds** together numbers read from two positions and stores the result in a third position. The three integers **immediately after** the opcode tell you these three positions - the first two indicate the **positions** from which you should read the input values, and the third indicates the position at which the output should be stored.

For example, if your Intcode computer encounters 1,10,20,30, it should read the values at positions 10 and 20, add those values, and then overwrite the value at position 30 with their sum.

Opcode 2 works exactly like opcode 1, except it **multiplies** the two inputs instead of adding them. Again, the three integers after the opcode indicate where the inputs and outputs are, not their values.

Once you're done processing an opcode, **move to the next one** by stepping forward 4 positions.

For example, suppose you have the following program:

    1,9,10,3,2,3,11,0,99,30,40,50

For the purposes of illustration, here is the same program split into multiple lines:

1,9,10,3,
2,3,11,0,
99,
30,40,50

The first four integers, 1,9,10,3, are at positions 0, 1, 2, and 3. Together, they represent the first opcode (1, addition), the positions of the two inputs (9 and 10), and the position of the output (3). To handle this opcode, you first need to get the values at the input positions: position 9 contains 30, and position 10 contains 40. Add these numbers together to get 70. Then, store this value at the output position; here, the output position (3) is at position 3, so it overwrites itself. Afterward, the program looks like this:

1,9,10,**70**,
2,3,11,0,
99,
30,40,50

Step forward 4 positions to reach the next opcode, 2. This opcode works just like the previous, but it multiplies instead of adding. The inputs are at positions 3 and 11; these positions contain 70 and 50 respectively. Multiplying these produces 3500; this is stored at position 0:

**3500**,9,10,70,
2,3,11,0,
99,
30,40,50

Stepping forward 4 more positions arrives at opcode 99, halting the program.

Here are the initial and final states of a few more small programs:

- 1,0,0,0,99 becomes **2**,0,0,0,99 (1 + 1 = 2).
- 2,3,0,3,99 becomes 2,3,0,**6**,99 (3 \_ 2 = 6).
- 2,4,4,5,99,0 becomes 2,4,4,5,99,**9801** (99 \* 99 = 9801).
- 1,1,1,4,99,5,6,0,99 becomes **30**,1,1,4,**2**,5,6,0,99.

Once you have a working computer, the first step is to restore the gravity assist program (your puzzle input) to the "1202 program alarm" state it had just before the last computer caught fire. To do this,** before running the program**, replace position 1 with the value 12 and replace position 2 with the value 2. **What value is left at position 0** after the program halts?

{| part1 )}

## Approach

We can use the [intCode assembler](intcode.md) to solve the problem (for the original code before separating the intcode functions, see [d02_2019Standalone.md](d02_2019Standalone.md)).

```elm {l}
nounVerbProg : Int -> Int -> Computer
nounVerbProg noun verb =
    puzzleInput
        |> initComputer [ 0 ]
        |> poke 1 noun
        |> poke 2 verb
        |> runProg
```

```elm {l r}
part1 : Int
part1 =
    nounVerbProg 9 10
        |> read Immediate 0
```

{( part2 |}

"Good, the new computer seems to be working correctly! **Keep it nearby** during this mission - you'll probably use it again. Real Intcode computers support many more features than your new one, but we'll let you know what they are as you need them."

"However, your current priority should be to complete your gravity assist around the Moon. For this mission to succeed, we should settle on some terminology for the parts you've already built."

Intcode programs are given as a list of integers; these values are used as the initial state for the computer's **memory**. When you run an Intcode program, make sure to start by initializing memory to the program's values. A position in memory is called an **address** (for example, the first value in memory is at "address 0").

Opcodes (like 1, 2, or 99) mark the beginning of an **instruction**. The values used immediately after an opcode, if any, are called the instruction's **parameters**. For example, in the instruction 1,2,3,4, 1 is the opcode; 2, 3, and 4 are the parameters. The instruction 99 contains only an opcode and has no parameters.

The address of the current instruction is called the **instruction pointer**; it starts at 0. After an instruction finishes, the instruction pointer increases by the **number of values in the instruction**; until you add more instructions to the computer, this is always 4 (1 opcode + 3 parameters) for the add and multiply instructions. (The halt instruction would increase the instruction pointer by 1, but it halts the program instead.)

"With terminology out of the way, we're ready to proceed. To complete the gravity assist, you need to determine **what pair of inputs produces the output 19690720**."

The inputs should still be provided to the program by replacing the values at addresses 1 and 2, just like before. In this program, the value placed in address 1 is called the **noun**, and the value placed in address 2 is called the **verb**. Each of the two input values will be between 0 and 99, inclusive.

Once the program has halted, its output is available at address 0, also just like before. Each time you try a pair of inputs, make sure you first **reset the computer's memory to the values in the program** (your puzzle input) - in other words, don't reuse memory from a previous attempt.

Find the input **noun** and **verb** that cause the program to produce the output 19690720. **What is 100 \* noun + verb?** (For example, if noun=12 and verb=2, the answer would be 1202.)

{| part2 )}

## Approach

The brute force approach would be to try all combinations of noun and verb between 0 and 99 each until we get the desired output. In this case, it is fast enough to suffice:

```elm {l}
target : Int
target =
    19690720
```

```elm {l r}
part2 : List Int
part2 =
    let
        mem =
            puzzleInput |> initComputer [ 0 ]
    in
    gridLocations ( 0, 0 ) ( 99, 99 )
        |> List.map
            (\( n, v ) ->
                if (nounVerbProg n v |> read Immediate 0) == target then
                    Just (100 * n + v)

                else
                    Nothing
            )
        |> List.filterMap identity
```

### Reflection

I do like this kind of puzzle, and great to see hints that _Intcode_ will be developed in later puzzles.

I wasn't entirely happy with a brute force approach to part 2. There was always the risk that certain combinations of noun and verb could lead to non halting programs, or ones that did not halt in a practical amount of time. In the end this wasn't a problem, but as an experiment I wanted to see the relation between inputs and output.

Here are the values for (0,0) (0,1) (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1) and (2,2):

```elm {r}
outputs : List ( Int, Int, Int )
outputs =
    let
        mem =
            puzzleInput |> initComputer [ 0 ]
    in
    gridLocations ( 0, 0 ) ( 2, 2 )
        |> List.map (\( n, v ) -> ( n, v, nounVerbProg n v |> read Immediate 0 ))
```

This suggests a linear relationship in the form:

    out = dx * noun + dy * verb + x0y0 ..................................... (1)

where dx is the difference in output between two consecutive noun values, dy the difference in output between two consecutive verb values and x0y0 is the output at (noun=0, verb=0).

In the case of the puzzle input:

    dx = 567476 - 337076 = 230400
    dy = 337077 - 337076 = 1
    x0y0 = 337076

Because dx is more than 99 times as large as dy, there can only be one noun value that could generate a result within 99.dy of the target:

    noun = floor ((target - x0y0) / dx)

Using this, we can find the verb value by plugging back into (1). Assuming all puzzle inputs generate a planar relationship between (noun,verb) and output and that dx > 99\*dy, we have a general algebraic solution:

```elm {l r}
part2Algebraic : Int
part2Algebraic =
    let
        ( x0y0, x0y1, x1y0 ) =
            [ ( 0, 0 ), ( 0, 1 ), ( 1, 0 ) ]
                |> List.map (\( n, v ) -> ( n, v, nounVerbProg n v |> read Immediate 0 ))
                |> List.map tripletThird
                |> tripletFromList
                |> Maybe.withDefault ( 0, 0, 0 )

        dx =
            x1y0 - x0y0

        dy =
            x0y1 - x0y0

        noun =
            (target - x0y0) // dx

        verb =
            (target - x0y0 - dx * noun) // dy
    in
    noun * 100 + verb
```
