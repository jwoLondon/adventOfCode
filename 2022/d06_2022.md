# Day 6 (2022): Tuning Trouble

'Part One' and 'Part Two' puzzle descriptions and puzzle input from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/6).

## Part 1

**How many characters need to be processed before the first start-of-packet marker is detected?**

We can pass a moving window of 4 characters over the input stream and test for uniqueness of characters in the window by comparing the length of list and set versions of the window.

```elm {l}
marker : Int -> Int -> List Char -> Int
marker msgLen pos stream =
    case stream of
        hd :: tl ->
            if (List.take msgLen stream |> Set.fromList |> Set.size) == msgLen then
                pos

            else
                marker msgLen (pos + 1) tl

        _ ->
            -- No unique message found
            0
```

```elm {l r}
part1 : Int
part1 =
    puzzleInput
        |> String.toList
        |> marker 4 4
```

## Part 2

**How many characters need to be processed before the first start-of-message marker is detected?**

This is a trivial extension where we set the block length to 14 rather than 4, still looking for a block of unique characters.

```elm {l r}
part2 : Int
part2 =
    puzzleInput
        |> String.toList
        |> marker 14 14
```

## Reflection

The puzzles seem a little easier this year, so far at least. Perhaps I was lucky in my approach to Part 1 in providing a generalisable solution for any length of block, therefor making Part 2 simply a case of changing the block size.

There are more efficient approaches to the problem in that the current solution moves through the stream one character at a time recalculating the set from the window each time. Instead we could jump forward to the last case of non-unique characters in the window, but this doesn't feel necessary for input of this size.
