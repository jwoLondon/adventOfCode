# Day 1 (2022): XXX

'Part One' and 'Part Two' puzzle descriptions and puzzle input from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/1).

See also, my [Observable JavaScript solution](https://observablehq.com/@jwolondon/advent-of-code-2022-day-1).

## Part 1

Find the Elf carrying the most Calories. **How many total Calories is that Elf carrying?**

### Parsing

Parsing the input text is simple, splitting by double new lines to get each elf's list of calories and then splitting by single new line to separate each snack's calorie value.

```elm {l}
parse : String -> List (List Int)
parse =
    String.split "\n\n"
        >> List.map (String.split "\n" >> List.filterMap String.toInt)
```

Now we have each elf's calorie list in its own array, we just sum the values and find the one with the largest total.

```elm {l r}
part1 : Int
part1 =
    puzzleInput
        |> parse
        |> List.map List.sum
        |> List.maximum
        |> Maybe.withDefault 0
```

## Part 2

Find the top three Elves carrying the most Calories. **How many Calories are those Elves carrying in total?**

Similar to Part 1 except we sort the calorie totals for the elves in order to select the top three values before summing them.

```elm {l r}
part2 : Int
part2 =
    puzzleInput
        |> parse
        |> List.map List.sum
        |> List.sort
        |> List.reverse
        |> List.take 3
        |> List.sum
```

## Reflection

A nice easy start this year. Allows application of some standard array processing. I wrote the original solution in JavaScript (see my [Observable solution](https://observablehq.com/@jwolondon/advent-of-code-2022-day-1)) keeping to a reasonably functional style, so expressing the solution in Elm was quite simple.
