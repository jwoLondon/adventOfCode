# Day 3 (2020): Toboggan Trajectory

'Part One' and 'Part Two' puzzle descriptions and puzzle input from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/3)

## Part 1

To represent the tiled woodland, we can represent each horizontal strip of trees and gaps with a rotatable deque and therefore each tile as a list of rotatable strips.

```elm {l}
type alias Tile =
    List (Deque Int)
```

By converting the input into lists of 1s and 0s, we make tree counting simpler.

```elm {l}
parse : List String -> Tile
parse =
    let
        treeToNum c =
            if c == '#' then
                1

            else
                0
    in
    List.map (String.toList >> List.map treeToNum >> Deque.fromList)
```

To traverse through the woods, proceed through each strip in a tile, rotating each by _slope_ cells more than the previous one (3 in this case).

```elm {l}
traverse : Int -> Tile -> Int
traverse slope tile =
    let
        isTree offset =
            AOC.rotateDeque offset >> Deque.first >> Maybe.withDefault 0

        offsets =
            List.map ((*) slope) (List.range 0 (List.length tile - 1))
    in
    List.map2 isTree offsets tile
        |> List.sum
```

```elm {l r}
part1 : Int
part1 =
    puzzleInput
        |> parse
        |> traverse 3
```

---

## Part 2

For all slopes that involve moving down 1 strip, we already have functions to count the trees from part 1. For the last case moving down 2 strips at a time we can remove alternate strips from the tile before traversing it.

```elm {l}
removeAlternate : List a -> List a
removeAlternate =
    AOC.groupsOf 2 >> List.concatMap (List.take 1)
```

```elm {l r}
part2 : Int
part2 =
    let
        t =
            parse puzzleInput
    in
    traverse 1 t * traverse 3 t * traverse 5 t * traverse 7 t * traverse 1 (removeAlternate t)
```

## Reflection

The key to this solution was representing each horizontal transect through the woods as a rotatable list. It was easy to implement with the utility function `AOC.rotateDeque` from previous years.

My initial attempt at a part 1 answer was incorrect as I misremembered the slope as 2 across not 3 across (I think I had a knight's move in my head).
