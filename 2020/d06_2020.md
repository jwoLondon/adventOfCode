# Day 6 (2020): Custom Customs

'Part One' and 'Part Two' puzzle descriptions and puzzle input from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/6)

## Part 1

We need to parse the input so that we can store each set of question responses within the group to which they belong.

```elm {l}
type alias Responses =
    List (List (Set Char))
```

```elm {l}
parse : String -> Responses
parse =
    String.split "\n\n"
        >> List.map (String.lines >> List.map (String.toList >> Set.fromList))
```

We can then simply accumulate the sizes of the sets of all group responses, taking care to treat each group separately.

```elm {l r}
part1 : Int
part1 =
    puzzleInput
        |> parse
        |> List.map (AOC.unions >> Set.size)
        |> List.sum
```

## Part 2

For each group we need to know the group's responses and find their intersection.

```elm {l r}
part2 : Int
part2 =
    parse puzzleInput
        |> List.map (AOC.intersections >> Set.size)
        |> List.sum
```

## Reflection

This was a puzzle well suited to a functional approach with bulk set operations. Care was needed to ensure individual and group responses were assembled appropriately, but ultimately, the solution a simple and concisely expressed one.

My first attempt for part two separately assembled groups and individual answers and then intersected them, but since the group set is simply the union of all individual answers, this was unnecessary. In the end parts one and two were identical except that the first applied a set union operation, the second applied a set intersection operation. I like how this puzzle encourages pattern matching and abstraction computational thinking.

I added generic `unions` and `intersections` functions to the [AOC utilities module](../examples/aocExamples.md#unions), equivalent to Haskell's, for combining a list of sets, but this is just a syntactic sugar for folding set operations over lists of sets.
