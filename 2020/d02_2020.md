# Day 2 (2020): Password Philosophy

'Part One' and 'Part Two' puzzle descriptions and puzzle input from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/2)

## Part 1

Most of the work is in extracting the relevant details of the policy and password for each line of input. We can do this with some simple regex.

```elm {l}
type alias Policy =
    ( Int, Int, String )
```

```elm {l}
parse : List String -> List ( Policy, String )
parse =
    let
        parseLine line =
            case
                AOC.submatches "(\\d+)[-](\\d+) (.): (.+)" line
                    |> List.filterMap identity
            of
                [ a, b, c, p ] ->
                    ( ( AOC.toInt a, AOC.toInt b, c ), p )

                _ ->
                    ( ( 0, 0, "" ), "" ) |> Debug.log "bad input"
    in
    List.map parseLine
```

Once we have a structure to hold the policy, it is easy to implement the validity rule for any given policy and password:

```elm {l}
isValid : ( Policy, String ) -> Bool
isValid ( ( mn, mx, chr ), pwd ) =
    let
        numOccurrences c =
            String.indices c >> List.length
    in
    (numOccurrences chr pwd >= mn) && (numOccurrences chr pwd <= mx)
```

```elm {l r}
part1 : Int
part1 =
    puzzleInput
        |> parse
        |> List.map isValid
        |> List.filter identity
        |> List.length
```

---

## Part 2

This is just a case of providing a new validation rule remembering to count from 1 not 0.

```elm {l}
isValid2 : ( Policy, String ) -> Bool
isValid2 ( ( mn, mx, chr ), pwd ) =
    let
        m1 =
            String.dropLeft (mn - 1) pwd |> String.startsWith chr

        m2 =
            String.dropLeft (mx - 1) pwd |> String.startsWith chr
    in
    (m1 && not m2) || (m2 && not m1)
```

```elm {l r}
part2 : Int
part2 =
    puzzleInput
        |> parse
        |> List.map isValid2
        |> List.filter identity
        |> List.length
```

## Reflection

Another relatively simple early puzzle. Most of the work was in remembering my regex to extract the various parts of the input. I wonder if we will see more one-indexed counting in later puzzles. Off-by-one errors are common enough when working though AoC puzzles, but this might just guarantee a few more.
